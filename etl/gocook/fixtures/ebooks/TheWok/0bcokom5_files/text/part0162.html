<p class="image"><img src="../images/00388.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre4"/></p>
<p class="noindent_paraavt"><span class="dropcap1">M</span>y wife, Adri, and I started keeping track of all the different noodles we’ve eaten in Asia over the years. (OK, I keep track; she keeps busy trying to discover brand-new ways of telling me she’s sick of noodles.) We’ve had long, thin, noodles in broth in Beijing. We’ve had wide, flat hand-stretched noodles in chile oil in Wuhan. We’ve had flat steamed rice noodles in Saigon and stir-fried rice sticks in Bangkok. We’ve had bright yellow alkalized wheat noodles doused in chiles and mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns in Chengdu alongside noodles made by pouring a sweet potato starch batter through a potato ricer into a pot of simmering water. We’ve eaten stir-fried noodles with dark soy sauce for breakfast in Indonesia and vermicelli in spicy coconut broth for lunch in Malaysia.</p>
<p class="indent_para">We’ve had steamed bean starch noodles with cucumbers and cilantro in Xi’an and noodles tossed with ground pork and preserved mustard root in Chongqing. We’ve eaten buckwheat noodles on a snowy mountainside in Nagano and stir-fried yakisoba <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_295" title="295"></span>in Kyoto. We’ve eaten pale white wheat noodles doused with sesame paste and chile oil in Shanghai,<sup class="calibre10"><a id="footnote-035-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0162.html#footnote-035" class="calibre6">*</a></sup> fried egg noodles in curry broth in Chiang Mai, and crispy panfried noodles in Singapore. We saw noodles that were pulled, peeled, extruded, twisted, kneaded, cut, sliced, steamed, rolled, tossed, flicked, and lovingly caressed before being firmly slapped down onto a steel table. Noodles for breakfast, noodles for lunch, noodles for dinner, noodles for elevensies, noodles for a midnight snack, noodles for a pre-midnight-snack snack. You’d have to be a true wet noodle to ever get bored of noodles (though I don’t blame Adri).</p>
<p class="indent_para">Does all of this variety make you a little uncomfortable? Don’t worry; me too. Despite having grown up in a Japanese household where noodles were a staple, I <i class="calibre9">still</i> get a little nervous when I head into the Asian supermarket to pick up some fresh noodles for dinner, knowing that I’m going to have to pick from dozens of different packages that all look sort of similar, marked in unfamiliar languages.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Well, here’s the good news. Once you learn a few of the basics and get a general grasp of what you’re looking at, you’ll find that a lot of the choices really boil down to nothing more than brand loyalty. And just like your spaghetti carbonara is gonna work even if the supermarket was out of DeCecco and you had to pick up a box of Barilla, the odds of ruining your dinner (or midnight snack!) because you picked up some noodles that were not <i class="calibre9">exactly</i> right are pretty low.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Still, you can improve these odds by understanding the basic categories of noodles you’ll find and what specific dishes and situations they’re best used for. Rather than bother with the impossible task of being comprehensive, I’m just going to do my darnedest to be useful. In this guide you’ll find a few common noodle-related terms that can help with identification, followed by a thorough guide to the Asian noodles you’re most likely to come across in the United States and the noodles that I find most useful for home cooks.</p>
<p class="indent_para">And if you don’t have access to Asian noodles at all, well don’t worry—when cooked right, even Italian pasta can be delicious in many Asian noodle dishes (see “Turn Spaghetti into Ramen,” <a href="part0163.html#page_300a" class="calibre5">here</a>).</p>
<p class="h1">NOODLE TERMS</p>
<p class="noindent_para">Before we get to specific types of noodles, here are a few basic noodle terms to be aware of when looking at packaging or recipes. In most recipes, unless you want to be a real stickler, any noodles within a broad category will work. Any type of wheat noodle (<i class="calibre9">mein, mien,</i> or <i class="calibre9">miàn</i>) can be substituted for another. Recipes that call for vermicelli-style noodles will work with any vermicelli, whether rice, mung bean, or sweet potato based.</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Miàn, mien, or mein</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">The Chinese term for wheat noodles (think: lo mein or chow mein) or <i class="calibre9">mien</i>. Many Japanese noodles share this etymological root, ra<b class="calibre2">men</b> and so<b class="calibre2">men</b>, for instance.</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Fěn or fun</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Chinese noodles made from nonwheat starches, such as <i class="calibre9">hor fun</i> (the wide steamed rice noodles that Beef Chow Fun, <a href="part0205.html#page_365" class="calibre5">here</a>, is made from) or <i class="calibre9">mi fun</i> (thin dried rice noodles used in soups and stir-fries throughout Asia).</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Chow</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para"><i class="calibre9">Chow</i> is a stir-fry. The Chinese symbol for chow, 炒, is composed of 火 (“fire”) and 少 (“little” or “less”), indicating a quick cooking method. Combine it with miàn or fěn and you’ve got chow mein and chow fun, a couple of classic noodle stir-fries. (This is also where we get the American English term “chow,” as in, “chow down.”)</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Hand-pulled</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para"><i class="calibre9">Lā</i> translates from Mandarin as “to pull.” Hand-pulled noodles (<i class="calibre9">lāmiàn</i>) are made from wheat flour doughs that are stretched by hand to form noodles. The thinness of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_296" title="296"></span>the noodle depends on how long the dough is stretched. Master noodle-makers can start with a solid block of dough and transform it into a single noodle hundreds of meters long with the width of a strand of angel hair pasta as they repeatedly lift, twist, fold, and stretch the dough. Some hand-pulled noodles, on the other hand, are wide and stubby with a heartier texture. Think pappardelle vs. capellini.</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Alkaline noodles</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Some Asian noodles, most notably ramen and some types of Chinese noodles, are made with water that has alkalizing minerals added to it. This liquid, known as <i class="calibre9">kansui</i> in Japanese, gives ramen noodles their characteristic yellow color, extra-springy and slippery texture, and a flavor that is a bit hard to describe. I find alkaline noodles to be a little sulphurous, a touch soapy, and definitely eggy (all in a good way).</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Vermicelli</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Any extra-thin noodle. Commonly made from rice, but you’ll also frequently find mung bean or sweet potato starch vermicelli.</p>
<p class="h1">HOW TO IDENTIFY NOODLES IN THE WILD</p>
<p class="noindent_para">Italians may be known for their pasta, but for sheer variety of fresh and dried noodles, Asia’s got them beat by a landslide.<sup class="calibre10"><a id="footnote-034-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0162.html#footnote-034" class="calibre6">*</a></sup> To be fair, they’ve had a head start. While pasta as we know it was developed in Italy sometime around the twelfth or thirteenth century (most likely well before Marco Polo’s famous trip to Asia), noodles have been consumed in China for several millennia. In 2005, a team of archaeologists led by Dr. Houyuan Lu of the Institute of Geology and Geophysics at Beijing’s Chinese Academy of Sciences identified the husks of millet used to produce noodle dough in a 4,000-year-old sealed earthenware container in Lajia, a Neolithic site in northwestern China. Noodles made from millet dough, which lacks the gluten-forming proteins found in wheat flour, would not have had the same elasticity and bite we expect in wheat-based Asian noodles today, but may have borne some resemblance to buckwheat soba or other nonwheat noodles.<sup class="calibre10"><a id="footnote-033-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0162.html#footnote-033" class="calibre6">†</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent_para">By the middle of the third century, during the Han Dynasty, noodles were already a staple part of the Han Chinese. By the end of the first millennium, wheat production was widespread in China and toothsome, elastic wheat noodles had become the norm. As noodles made their way across China and the rest of Asia, they’ve taken on countless forms and have been produced from a wide range of grains and vegetables. Today the range of diversity you’ll find in China alone is truly staggering. Expand that to the rest of Asia and it becomes a mind-breakingly huge variety.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Attempting to write a fully comprehensive guide would take up an encyclopedia-sized volume, so I am not going to. Instead, I’ll focus on the most common types of noodles you are likely to find at the supermarket, as well as a couple of the less common noodles that I happen to love.</p>

<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Cooking and Storage:</span> Fresh lāmiàn needs to be cooked in boiling water before it is used. Because Chinese noodles are typically salted before forming, you don’t need to use salted water as you would for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_297" title="297"></span>Italian pasta. Plain old boiling water is fine. Add the noodles to boiling water and cook al dente, then transfer immediately to hot soup or drain and dry well for a stir-fry or to serve cold.</p>
<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Similar Alternatives:</span> Fresh ramen or Italian spaghetti (or capellini) cooked in alkaline water (see “Turn Spaghetti into Ramen,” <a href="part0163.html#page_300a" class="calibre5">here</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Uses:</span> <i class="calibre9">Lo mein</i> is actually the name of a preparation, not just the noodles themselves, but you’ll often see noodles labeled “lo mein” or “for lo mein” in the United States. In Chinese cuisine, lo mein range from as thin as wonton noodles to slightly thicker and are typically served either stirred together with a sauce or braise or as a form of deconstructed wonton noodle soup: noodles, boiled wontons, and greens, with soup on the side. In the United States, lo mein noodles are thicker egg noodles and are almost always stir-fried in a soy-based sauce with vegetables and meat or seafood. These thicker noodles are what you want for my Chinese American Stir-Fried Lo Mein with Shiitake, Chives, and Charred Cabbage (<a href="part0193.html#page_348" class="calibre5">here</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Cooking and Storage:</span> Add the noodles to boiling water and cook al dente, then transfer immediately to hot soup or drain and dry well for a stir-fry or to serve cold.</p>
<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Similar Alternatives:</span> Fresh lāmiàn can be par-cooked in boiling water, drained, and stir-fried like lo mein, as can spaghetti cooked in alkaline water (see “Turn Spaghetti into Ramen with This One Easy Trick,” <a href="part0163.html#page_300a" class="calibre5">here</a>). <i class="calibre9">Cumian</i> are thick, rectangular noodles commonly used in Shanghai-style noodle dishes.</p>

<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Formation Method:</span> Hand-stretched or rolled and cut.</p>
<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Uses:</span> As with lo mein, <i class="calibre9">chow mein</i> is technically the name of the preparation, though you’ll find fresh noodles labeled “chow mein” at the Asian market. Chow mein are typically served panfried.</p>
<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Cooking and Storage:</span> Fresh chow mein should be boiled before stir-frying. Frequently, chow mein will be sold par-cooked and ready to fry, in which case they only need to be loosened up before stir-frying with a sauce to soften them up slightly, or panfried plain in oil to crisp into a sort of cake before being topped with saucy ingredients or finished with a sauce in the wok.</p>
<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Similar Alternatives:</span> Wonton noodles are essentially raw chow mein noodles and can be boiled, drained, and used in the same manner for panfrying or stir-frying.</p>

They’re also commonly used throughout Southeast Asia for soups and dry noodle dishes, such as <i class="calibre9">bami mu daeng</i> (Thai noodles with roast pork) and <i class="calibre9">mami</i> (Philippine noodle soup).</p>
<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Similar Alternatives:</span> In most cases you can use thin lāmiàn or ramen in place of wonton noodles, though they don’t have quite the same eggy flavor or firm texture.</p>
<p class="h4a"><span class="underline1"><b class="calibre7"><i class="calibre8">Biangbiang Miàn</i></b></span></p>

<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Main Ingredient:</span> Wheat starch</p>
<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Formation Method:</span> Liangpi are made by rinsing a wheat dough in water to release its starch. The dough is then discarded and the starchy water is allowed to rest overnight, during which time the wheat starch settles to the bottom of the container.

<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Other Names:</span> <i class="calibre9">Tteok</i> or <i class="calibre9">dduk</i> (Korea), Shanghai-style <i class="calibre9">nian gao</i> (China), <i class="calibre9">mochi</i> (Japan)</p>
<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Main Ingredient:</span> Glutinous rice</p>
<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Formation Method:</span> Traditionally, glutinous rice is pounded into a sticky dough that is then shaped and steamed. Modern rice cakes are made by machine and extruded. Korean dduk is usually shaped into short cylinders, while Shanghai-style nian gao is shaped into bias-cut disks. In Japan, mochi is formed into square cakes or small balls called <i class="calibre9">dango</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent_para"><span class="sanbld">Classic Uses:</span> There is a huge variety of rice cakes in Korea, China, and other Asian countries, which range from soft and sticky to firm and chewy. They are used in both savory and sweet applications and can be grilled, simmered, steamed, baked, or stir-fried. They are the main ingredient in Spicy Korean Rice Cake Stew (Gungmul Tteokbokki) with Kimchi (<a href="part0314.html#page_540" class="calibre5">here</a>) and in several other Korean and Chinese soups and stir-fries. In Japan, a softer form of rice cake called <i class="calibre9">mochi</i> is grilled, simmered, or baked (in modern times it is also formed around ice cream as a dessert). Rice cakes are a traditional food for New Year’s Day in Korea, China, and Japan.</p>
