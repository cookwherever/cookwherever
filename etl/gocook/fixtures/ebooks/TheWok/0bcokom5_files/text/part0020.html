<p class="noindent_para">This recipe combines a few classic Thai flavors (basil, chiles, and fish sauce) in a supersimple weeknight stir-fry that is not particularly authentic to any specific dish found in Thailand. This is the dish for the kind of weeknight where you don’t even want to bother mixing together a sauce. When I make dishes like this, I completely forgo the measuring spoons and scales. Eyeballing it and adjusting as you go is good enough.</p>

<p class="sbox-h">Rotten Anchovies, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Umami Bombs</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Barrels and barrels of months-old anchovies. That’s what I smelled that time I dropped an entire 750 ml bottle of fish sauce onto the hard tile floor of the kitchen at Clio, Ken Oringer’s former Boston restaurant where I had just started on the <i class="calibre9">garde-manger</i> station. To be honest, it wasn’t just me that smelled it. It was every cook, server, bartender, and guest in the restaurant. I watched as it dropped in slow motion, exploding like a grenade as the corner of the glass bottle hit the hard tile floor. The kitchen was immediately filled with a ripe stench that steadily wafted into the dining room over the course of the night. It took several days to dissipate completely.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">While it’s true that in large quantities fish sauce smells <i class="calibre9">terrible</i>, when used properly, it adds an incomparable depth of flavor and a big serving of umami to boot. Fermented fish-based condiments are old. In both China and the Mediterranean, fermented condiments made from salting and fermenting fish, meat, and soybeans date back to the third or fourth century B.C. Fish-based condiments dwindled in China when soy sauce became the condiment of choice around the first century A.D., but fish sauce maintained its popularity throughout Southeast Asia, where it remains the primary seasoning ingredient throughout Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, Burma, and the Philippines. A form of Malaysian fish sauce called <i class="calibre9">kecap</i> (see <a href="part0007.html#page_13a" class="calibre5">here</a>) is thought to be the precursor to modern ketchup.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">In Ancient Greece and Rome, a form of fish sauce called <i class="calibre9">garum</i> was produced originally by salting and fermenting fish guts. Garum of different qualities could be produced from the same batch of fish: after placing the fermented fish in a woven basket, the <i class="calibre9">liquamen</i> that dripped through the basket would be reserved for the upper classes, while the <i class="calibre9">allec</i> that remained—the muddy bits of fermented fish guts—were sold cheaply as seasoning. Eventually, rather than a by-product of fish guts, garum was produced primarily through the fermentation of mackerel, anchovies, and other oily fish.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">In modern times, the Neapolitan condiment <i class="calibre9">colatura di alici</i> is garum’s descendant, as is Worcestershire sauce, which gets some of its umami punch from fermented anchovies.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">Modern Asian fish sauce is produced by cleaning and draining small fish and shellfish, drying it, salting it, packing it into large wooden containers, and keeping it submerged in brine while bacterial fermentation takes place over the course of nine months to a year. This process breaks down fish proteins into individual amino acids, as well as other organic compounds and minerals. It’s these amino acids that give fish sauce its flavor-enhancing qualities. During fermentation, the fish liquefies, ending up as a sludgy mixture that is then strained and aged in the sun for a period of two or more weeks. It is clarified once more, then bottled.</p>
<p class="sidebar_sbq"><b class="calibre2">Q:</b> <b class="calibre2">How does fish sauce work? What does it add to dishes?</b></p>
<p class="sidebar_sbq-line"/>
<p class="sidebar_sba"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_71" title="71"></span><b class="calibre2">A:</b> As a condiment, fish sauce brings three distinct elements to the table: Saltiness, savoriness (or umami), and sweetness. Gram for gram, most fish sauces have nearly double the salt content of soy sauce (which means that you should use about half as much of it as you would soy sauce when seasoning a dish). Salt is vital in our perception of our flavor, as it opens up chemical pathways that allow us to perceive other flavors more easily. Properly salted food will taste more strongly of itself than unsalted food.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">Perhaps more important than salt, though, is fish sauce’s concentration of amino acids. In a 2010 study in the <i class="calibre9">Journal of Animal and Veterinary Advances</i>, researchers found that while the concentration of most amino acids would diminish in anchovies fermented for two months, the levels of three specific ones—glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and histadine—would skyrocket. The first two, glutamic acid and aspartic acid, are known to trigger our sensation of umami when it binds to receptors on our tongues. Histadine, on the other hand, has a sweet flavor, and indeed, many fish sauces have a distinctly sweet, almost caramel-like flavor to them.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">It’s these three flavors—salty, savory, and sweet—that give fish sauce its reputation as a potent flavor booster in all manner of dishes.</p>
<p class="sidebar_sbq"><b class="calibre2">Q:</b> <b class="calibre2">When should I use fish sauce?</b></p>
<p class="sidebar_sbq-line"/>
<p class="sidebar_sba"><b class="calibre2">A:</b> There are some obvious occasions. Fish sauce is an essential condiment in many Southeast Asian dishes, including Vietnamese pho and Pad Thai from Thailand (see <a href="part0209.html#page_378" class="calibre5">here</a>). But don’t stop there! I use a few drops of fish sauce as a finishing condiment in nearly every meat-based stew I make, whether it’s Asian or Western. Used sparingly, it melds into the background while doing its salty-savory-sweet magic to dishes ranging from Texas chili con carne to Italian ragù Bolognese to Hungarian goulash. I’ll add a splash to my <i class="calibre9">michelada</i> or Bloody Mary or even to my summer pesto. Once you start seasoning with fish sauce, you’ll never look at boring old salt the same way again.</p>
<p class="sidebar_sbq"><b class="calibre2">Q:</b> <b class="calibre2">What is the best brand of fish sauce?</b></p>
<p class="sidebar_sbq-line"/>
<p class="sidebar_sba"><b class="calibre2">A:</b> The flavor of fish sauce, like soy sauce, can vary from country to country. There’s a slow-aged Vietnamese fish sauce brand called Red Boat that’s all the rage today because it, like many Vietnamese fish sauces, has a milder, smoother flavor than, say Tiparos, a more pungent sauce you’ll find throughout Thailand. In taste tests, the milder fish sauces typically come out on top, but nearly every taste test I’ve seen suffers the same basic experimental design flaw: one of the tests is tasting the stuff on its own, which is not a useful taste test for anyone who doesn’t take shots of straight fish sauce with their dinner.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">In my own tests I’ve found that the only time a milder, more expensive fish sauce really makes a difference is in dipping sauces like Vietnamese nước chấm or Thai nam pla prik, and even then, most folks will notice a difference only when tasted directly side by side. When used as a seasoning, even the most one-dimensional fish sauces (such as, say, the inexpensive Squid or Three Crabs brand sauces) will work just fine.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">Bottom line: I keep a bottle of fancy-yet-widely-available Red Boat for dipping sauces (and appearances—god forbid my foodie friends see me cooking with Three Crabs!), and a bottle of whatever was available at the Asian supermarket or the international aisle of the Western supermarket for everything else.</p>
<p class="sidebar_sbq"><b class="calibre2">Q:</b> <b class="calibre2">How should I store fish sauce, and how long does it last?</b></p>
<p class="sidebar_sbq-line"/>
<p class="sidebar_sba"><b class="calibre2">A:</b> An unopened bottle of fish sauce stored in the pantry will last for years, if not decades. Once you’ve opened up the bottle, however, it will start to change in flavor. According to a 2013 study from the Bangladesh Agricultural University, fish sauce still contains active bacterial cultures, including <i class="calibre9">Bacillus, Micrococcus</i>, <i class="calibre9">Lactobacillus</i>, and <i class="calibre9">Pseudomonas</i>, even after bottling, and they will continue to digest and ferment the fish sauce in aerobic conditions. Even so, as long as its tightly sealed after each use (and your nose will tell you if it’s not), fish sauce should last at least six months in the pantry before it starts to seriously change in flavor, becoming a little more pungent and, well, fishier (but not in a good way) with time. With the cheaper stuff, you probably won’t even notice the difference. With subtler sauces like Red Boat, storing it in the fridge after opening will minimize bacterial activity and help it retain its original flavor for a year or more.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">In a bottle that is not perfectly sealed, water will also evaporate out of the fish sauce with time. Eventually this could lead to hypersalinity, which manifests as solid salt crystals that form on the bottom of the bottle or around the lid. Higher concentrations of protein can also lead to protein precipitation, which looks like cloudiness or crystals floating on the surface of the sauce. Neither the salt nor the protein crystals affect the palatability of fish sauce, and there’s no need to worry about it.</p>
