<p class="noindent_paraavtop"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_218" title="218"></span><span class="dropcap1">A</span>s the child of a Japanese American household, I grew up eating rice. A lot of rice. We ate it with our mapo tofu (<a href="part0347.html#page_598" class="calibre5">here</a>) and our Japanese curry. We stirred a raw egg into leftover rice to make <i class="calibre9">tamago-kake gohan</i> (<a href="part0111.html#page_230" class="calibre5">here</a>). On road trips my grandmother would pack a plastic container full of <i class="calibre9">onigiri—</i>Japanese rice balls that she seasoned with salt and MSG. We ate them wrapped in nori with a side of salty pickled plums—<i class="calibre9">umeboshi­</i> or on their own. White rice with a sprinkle of <i class="calibre9">furikake</i> (a seasoned Japanese rice topping; see <a href="part0301.html#page_521" class="calibre5">here</a>) was a reliable side dish at any meal. Indeed, the Japanese word for meal—<i class="calibre9">gohan—</i>is the same as the word for rice.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Similarly, my wife, as a Colombiana, also grew up eating rice. A lot of rice. Consequently, our daughter is also growing up eating rice. A lot of rice.</p>
<p class="indent_para">We’re going to be learning a lot about rice in this chapter. As you read it, you may notice that not every recipe uses the wok. Despite the conceit of this book, it seemed a shame not to share some of my favorite ways to enjoy rice. I apologize in advance for any extra deliciousness that may ensue.</p>
<p class="h">We’ve Got Rice. You’ve Got Questions.</p>
<p class="noindent_para">Rice in Asia is as much a cultural cornerstone as bread in Europe or corn in Mexico. But what makes it unique? Well, it starts with the quantity of it consumed.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">How much rice do we really eat in the world?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> As the staple grain throughout Asia and the Middle East, as well as much of Africa and Central and South America, rice is the main nutrition source for over 60 percent of the world’s population. Though corn is the most widely produced grain in the world (around 850 million metric tons annually, compared to rice’s 725), rice is the most popular grain for human consumption (much of the corn grown in the world is used for animal feed, or further processing into other ingredients).</p>
<p class="box_parain">This is surprising, given that rice is more labor- and resource-extensive to produce than other grains. Not only does it generally take more water to grow and more labor to harvest (travel to Asia and you’ll still find fields and fields of rice paddies tended to by human hands), but it’s also more tedious to process. This is not so much because of its makeup or shape, but because while wheat and corn are typically ground into flour or meal, rice is unique among grains in that humans have developed a taste for eating it whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">I don’t get it. Why does grinding other grains into flour make them less labor-intensive? Isn’t grinding an</i> <span class="noi">extra</span> <i class="calibre9">step?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Grains have three key parts: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm. In refined flours (like the white flour you use to bake biscuits), the bran and germ are completely removed. Whole-grain flours still contain those bits. With flours and meals, the process for removing the bran and germ is industrialized and efficient. Grains are ground or rolled whole, then sieved to remove <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_219" title="219"></span>the undesirable bits. Rice, on the other hand, is generally consumed in grain form, not as a flour, which means that the outer layers must be carefully removed from each grain during processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">Ah, I got it. So how about . . .</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> But wait! There’s more. Not only does rice have the same bran layer that wheat and corn have; it also has a husk on top of that. Think of it like undressing a toddler. It’s hard enough to keep them still while you pull off their jacket and pants. By the time you get to the shirt and underwear, they’ve had it, and sometimes, no amount of Tumbleleaf can help. Rice is like wheat that’s wearing an extra jacket. Like wheat and corn, rice has a bran and germ that needs to be removed. But it’s also got an extra layer of husk. Even the healthy “whole-grain” stuff—brown rice—has had that husk layer removed before drying and packaging.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> Wow, that is a lot of extra work! Here’s my next que . . .</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> That’s not all! After the husk, bran, and germ have all been removed, rice is further polished to remove aleurone, the layer of fats and proteins that form the outer coat of the endosperm. This is the bit that turns rancid when brown rice is stored too long. Removing it is essential to extending the storage life for rice.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> Are you finished? Can I speak o . . .</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> It gets worse! Corn and wheat are grown in huge quantities with relatively few varieties—they are monocrops—while rice is extraordinarily varied. Just think about trying to make sushi with fragrant Indian basmati rice or serving sticky glutinous Thai rice with your beans and enchiladas. For a worldwide staple, rice is still a fiercely regional food. In larger Asian markets, the varieties of rice you’ll find on the shelves are as numerous as, well, grains of rice.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">Alright, alright. I get it. So why do we bother with all that processing? Why don’t people in Asia just eat wheat and corn?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> There’s not a simple answer to that question, but the most obvious is that humans have developed a taste for the stuff. We <i class="calibre9">like</i> it whole. Sure, some people <i class="calibre9">pretend</i> to like whole-grain wheatberries, and that fancy restaurant down the street might be serving farro risotto to folks who’d secretly rather be eating the real stuff, but rice? We like rice, we like it in grain-sized bits, and we’re willing to go through great lengths to get it. Indeed, though these days we mainly eat one species of rice, <i class="calibre9">Oryza sativa</i> (albeit in a wide range of cultivars), rice was actually domesticated as a staple independently on three separate continents, South America, Africa, and Asia. (The South American variety was replaced with Asian rice when the Spaniards came to the New World, while the African variety is rarely seen outside of Africa.)</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> I’ve noticed that the Chinese restaurant down the street serves rice that’s different from the sushi place, and <span class="noi">really</span> different from the Indian restaurant. What gives?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Broadly, rice falls into two categories: <i class="calibre9">indica</i> and <i class="calibre9">japonica</i>.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1"><b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre9">Japonica</i></b></span> rice is grown in temperate or high-altitude locations, like the more mountainous regions of northern China, Japan, and Korea. Much of the <i class="calibre9">japonica</i> rice sold and consumed in the United States is grown in California. <i class="calibre9"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_220" title="220"></span>Japonica</i> typically has shorter grains than <i class="calibre9">indica.</i> Most medium- or short-grain rices are <i class="calibre9">japonica</i>, including the Arborio used for risotto, the Bomba used for paella, sushi rice, and the steamed rice at your local Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Japonica rice is notable for its texture. It sticks together in moist clumps, or, in the case of risotto or paella, offers up extra starch to make its own creamy sauce.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1"><b class="calibre2"><i class="calibre9">Indica</i></b></span> rice is grown in tropical and subtropical lowland areas, like India, much of Southeast Asia, and the American South. Unlike <i class="calibre9">japonica</i> rice, <i class="calibre9">indica</i> varieties cook up with individual grains, giving it a loose, fluffier texture. Carolina rice is <i class="calibre9">indica</i>. So are basmati and jasmine or the rice you get at the Persian restaurant. The rice you’ll find in Louisiana Creole red beans and rice is <i class="calibre9">indica</i>.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Interestingly, you’ll find that in countries where stickier varieties of rice prevail—Japan and China, for instance—rice is typically consumed with chopsticks. In places that favor Indica—India, much of Southeast Asia, the Southern United States, and the Middle East, for instance—rice is typically eaten with forks, spoons, or fingers.</p>
<p class="box_parain">For more details on different types of rice, see the chart on <a href="part0106.html#page_224" class="calibre5">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> What’s this “converted rice” all about?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Converted rice is rice, typically long- or medium-grain <i class="calibre9">indica</i> varieties, that have been par-cooked and dried <i class="calibre9">before</i> the husk, bran, and germ are removed. The par-cooking not only let’s the rice cook faster at home, but it also imparts some of the nutrients from the outer layers to the central germ. Uncle Ben’s is the most well-known converted rice.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">Occasionally I see bags labeled “New Crop” at the Asian grocery store. What does that mean?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> “New Crop” rice is exactly what it sounds like: rice from the first, or newest, harvest of the year. Like beans and other dried goods, <i class="calibre9">japonica</i> rice has a long but not indefinite shelf life, and as time goes on, starch granules will tighten and surface proteins start to form a hardened layer on the surface of each grain. Thus, New Crop <i class="calibre9">japonica</i> rice typically releases its aroma better and cooks up a little more tender and sticky than non-new-crop rice. In many countries, new-crop rice is an annual luxury people will indulge in. I try to pick up a bag of it whenever I see it on the shelf, usually around early December.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Because it is fresher and absorbs water more easily, I never rinse new-crop rice before cooking.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><i class="calibre9">Indica</i> rices that are prized for the firm, individual grains, on the other hand, are frequently aged—basmati rice in particular, where the best stuff can be aged for a year or more to improve grain texture and develop its fragrant aroma.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">But what rice is best? I need to know, because I’m having a debate on the Internet and I NEED to be right.</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Whatever your position is, if you’ve picked a <i class="calibre9">best</i> rice, you’re wrong. I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="box_parain">It all depends on the situation and your personal preference. Some folks love brown rice for its nutty flavor, chewy texture, or health benefits. Other prefer the moist clumps of medium-grain rice or the floral aroma of Thai jasmine rice.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Most of the rice I cook at home is <i class="calibre9">japonica</i> rice grown in California. Growing up, my family ate mostly <i class="calibre9">japonica</i>, and it’s what I stock most frequently in my own pantry. Koshihikari is a widely available variety that seems to clump in perfectly bite-sized nuggets that are easy to pick <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_221" title="221"></span>up with chopsticks. It has a delicate floral aroma and a pleasantly firm chew when properly cooked. (Think: al dente pasta.) I like Tamaki Gold brand, a premium brand from California that is available in both white (hulled) and brown (whole grain) varieties.</p>
<p class="box_parain">But when it comes to rice, I’m a firm believer in free love. If I’m making an Indian meal, I’ll cook basmati. If I’m making Thai food, I may break out the jasmine or even the glutinous sticky rice.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Calrose, a <i class="calibre9">japonica</i> variety also grown in California, is the most popular medium-grain rice in the world for a reason. It is mildly fragrant and cooks up very tender and moderately sticky. It’s most likely what you’re getting at the Chinese restaurant and is especially ideal for fried rice (<a href="part0143.html#page_268" class="calibre5">here</a>). Kokuho Rose is a popular brand of Calrose that I enjoy with lots of Chinese stir-fries.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">So . . . should I rinse my rice or not? I have an Asian mother-in-law, if that makes any difference.</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Rinsing rice removes some of the powdered starch that is clinging to its surface, resulting in looser, more separate grains than unrinsed rice. But whether you rinse or not comes down to personal preference and the exact brand of rice you’re using. Broadly, if you’re using an <i class="calibre9">indica</i> variety where individual grains are expected, it’s useful to rinse them to reduce excess starch. However, with these varieties, since the starch and trace vitamins and minerals on the surface are removed during rinsing anyway, you can accomplish the same goal (and eliminate the difficulty of nailing that perfect water-to-rice ratio) by just boiling them in way too much water, like pasta.</p>
<p class="box_parain">I know. Blasphemy. Delicious, foolproof blasphemy.</p>
<p class="box_parain">With <i class="calibre9">japonica</i> varieties, rinsing can be useful if your rice often comes out gummy or too sticky, but personally, I rarely bother other than in very specific circumstances (if I’m making sushi, for instance, I’d rather not have my rice be too sticky).</p>
<p class="box_parain">Rinsing relatively unprocessed brown rice accomplishes very little. (I can’t help you with the mother-in-law situation.)</p>
<p class="box_parain">The one time you’ll always want to rinse rice is if you plan on cooking it and immediately using it for fried rice (see <a href="part0143.html#page_270" class="calibre5">here</a>). The excess starch can cause it to clump in the wok, which will require you to add more oil, leading to heavy, greasy results. Rinsing the rice prevents this issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">OK, I get that</i> <span class="noi"><b class="calibre2">japonica</b></span> <i class="calibre9">rice is stickier than</i> <span class="noi"><b class="calibre2">indica</b></span> <i class="calibre9">rice, but what is</i> <span class="noi"><b class="calibre2">sticky</b></span> <i class="calibre9">rice? Is that the same as sushi rice? And is it OK to eat it if I’m on a gluten-free diet?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> “Sticky rice” does not mean simply “rice that is sticky”! Although sushi rice or even the steamed rice at Chinese restaurants is sometimes referred to as “sticky rice,” it should really be called “stickier than <i class="calibre9">indica</i> rice” rice. Actual sticky rice is a few specific varieties (of both <i class="calibre9">indica</i> and <i class="calibre9">japonica</i>) that are exceptionally low in amylose and high in amylopectin, making them glue-like and sticky. The dry grains are easily distinguishable from standard rice by their opaque white appearance. They look chalky, as opposed to translucent.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Sticky rice is famously served with sweet mangoes and coconut syrup in Thai mango sticky rice and in many types of Chinese dim sum, where it can be steamed in bamboo leaves, formed into a paste and wrapped around sesame paste, deep-fried into dumplings, or made into rice cakes for stir-fry. Glutinous rice is also very popular in Burma.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Glutinous rice also has uses outside of cooking. One of my favorite ways to use it (and the main reason I keep a bag of it around) is to toast it dry, crush it in a mortar and pestle, and use it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_222" title="222"></span>to flavor dipping sauces like <i class="calibre9">Jaew</i> (<a href="part0246.html#page_440" class="calibre5">here</a>) or sprinkle it over Lao or Isan Thai <i class="calibre9">larp</i> salads.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><i class="calibre9">Glutinous</i> should not be confused with <i class="calibre9">glutenous</i>. The former refers to the glue-like texture of glutinous rice, while the latter refers to gluten, the protein matrix formed when flour and water are combined. Glutinous rice contains no gluten and is perfectly fine for folks on a gluten-free diet.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">And “broken” rice? Why would I want to buy something that’s broken?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Broken rice is exactly what it sounds like: rice grains that have been broken into smaller pieces. It is typically used for dishes like congee (<a href="part0127.html#page_249" class="calibre5">here</a>), a thick rice porridge in which you <i class="calibre9">want</i> extra starch released and the rice grains to break down. You can make congee just fine with unbroken rice, but broken rice is cheaper and cooks faster, making it a popular choice in Asian households.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">Why do they call it “steamed rice” anyway, when it’s not really steamed?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> You got me. I guess it sounds better than “simmered rice,” or, if frequently when I’m trying to cook it, “rice that’s steamed in the middle, raw on the top, and burnt on the bottom.” There are some rices that are truly steamed, notably Thai sticky rice, which is traditionally steamed in bamboo baskets over simmering water.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">How do you feel about those microwavable single-serving bowls of white or brown rice that have been popping up at my supermarket or Asian market?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> As a convenience food, they’re great. They cook in about 90 seconds in the microwave, and they taste pretty decent, though occasionally a bit mushier than I prefer. I use them when I’m in a pinch and my daughter needs a quick snack (or it’s late night and I’m feeling peckish and lazy). The major downside is the packaging and price. Good brands, like Tamaki, cost about $1.75 apiece for a single serving of rice, and of course, that’s one plastic bowl to recycle for each serving you use. A much better option is to just cook more rice than you need each time you cook a batch and save the extra for the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">OK, so if I cook more rice than I need, what’s the best way to store and reheat it? Does it come out as good after reheating?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> I store cooked rice in sealed deli containers in the fridge, or, if I know I’m not going to eat it within the next week or so, in zipper-lock freezer bags. I put the rice in the bag, squeeze the air out as I seal it, then press the rice down into a flat, even layer for rapid freezing and defrosting.</p>
<p class="box_parain">But rice, like any starch-based food, gets stale as it cools and sits, which means that its starches revert from a loose, gel-like structure to a more rigid crystalline structure, making the individual grains taste dry and unpleasantly firm. Staleness is a separate phenomenon from dryness—breads and rice can get stale without losing moisture and can lose moisture without getting stale. This means that even in a perfectly airtight container, rice will get stale as it cools in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Fortunately, cold rice is very easy to revive. There are a couple ways to do it. The simplest is in the microwave, where it revives to pretty much as good as fresh, whether from the fridge or the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_223" title="223"></span>freezer. Crack the lid of your storage container a little bit to allow steam to escape or transfer the rice to a microwave-safe bowl with a microwave-safe plate placed on top of it and microwave on high power. Start with 60 seconds of heating time per cup of rice (or 90 seconds per cup if it’s coming from the freezer), then heat in 15-second intervals until it’s as hot as you’d like it.</p>
<p class="box_parain">If you don’t have a microwave, you can reheat rice by placing it in a bowl on top of a steamer insert set in a pot with a couple inches of simmering water. Place the lid on the pot and let the rice steam until it’s fully heated.</p>
<p class="box_parain">The other alternative is to not bother trying to reheat it to its original form at all. Stale, refrigerated rice works great in dishes like fried rice (268) and congee (249).</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">Oh—one more question! I’ve noticed that the rice served on the side at Chinese or Japanese restaurants can</i> <span class="noi"><b class="calibre2">smell</b></span> <i class="calibre9">great but sometimes taste kinda bland. What gives?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Most likely it’s because you are used to eating rice from parts of the Western world that typically salt their rice while cooking, whereas in Asia, rice is frequently cooked in plain, unsalted water. Having grown up in a Japanese American household, I find that Japanese rice cooked with salt tastes . . . wrong to me. As wrong as Carolina rice cooked without it.</p>
<p class="box_parain">The reason for this is not entirely clear, but the fact that rice in those Asian countries is frequently served alongside highly seasoned dishes is the most likely answer. It acts sort of as a palate cleanser—a neutral base to give your mouth a break from the assault of flavor in a typical stir-fry.</p>
<p class="box_parain">In many countries, in fact, it’s typical to have plain, unsalted steamed rice when it’s served as a side dish, but in dishes where the rice is the star, it’ll be seasoned. Fried rice is seasoned with salt, soy sauce, or oyster sauce. Sushi rice is seasoned with vinegar, salt, and sugar. The rice balls my grandmother packed for our road trips would be seasoned with salt and MSG before being shaped. Tamago-Kake Gohan (<a href="part0111.html#page_230" class="calibre5">here</a>) is rice mixed with an egg and salty soy sauce. I also love putting salty-sweet furikake on top of it.</p>
