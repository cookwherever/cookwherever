<p class="noindent_para_ts">This is my version of the Chinese American classic. A vodka-based batter and a double-fry makes the chicken extra crispy. Crispy enough that you can coat it in the sweet, sour, and mildly spicy sauce and let it sit for hours or days without losing its crispiness. Even reheated in the microwave, you’ll feel its crunch.</p>
<p class="ing-hb"><b class="calibre2">INGREDIENTS</b></p>
<p class="ing-ts">For the Marinade and Chicken:</p>
<p class="ing-list">1 large egg white</p>
<p class="ing-list">1 tablespoon (15 ml) light soy sauce or shoyu</p>
<p class="ing-list">2 tablespoons (30 ml) Shaoxing wine</p>
<p class="ing-list">2 tablespoons (30 ml) 80-proof vodka</p>
<p class="ing-list">¼ teaspoon (1 g) baking soda</p>
<p class="ing-list">3 tablespoons (9 g) cornstarch</p>
<p class="ing-list">1 pound (450 g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into ½- to ¾-inch chunks</p>
<p class="ing-ts">For the Dry Coating:</p>
<p class="ing-list">½ cup (2½ ounces/70 g) all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="ing-list">½ cup (2 ounces/60 g) cornstarch</p>
<p class="ing-list">½ teaspoon (3 g) baking powder</p>
<p class="ing-list">½ teaspoon (3 g) kosher salt</p>
<p class="ing-ts">For the Sauce:</p>
<p class="ing-list">2 tablespoons (30 ml) light soy sauce or shoyu</p>
<p class="ing-list">1 tablespoon (15 ml) dark soy sauce</p>
<p class="ing-list">1 tablespoon (3 g) cornstarch</p>
<p class="ing-list">2 tablespoons (30 ml) Shaoxing wine</p>
<p class="ing-list">2 tablespoons (30 ml) distilled white vinegar</p>
<p class="ing-list">3 tablespoons (45 ml) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock or water</p>
<p class="ing-list">¼ cup (50 g) sugar</p>
<p class="ing-list">1 teaspoon (5 ml) roasted sesame oil</p>
<p class="ing-list">2 teaspoons (10 ml) peanut, vegetable, or canola oil</p>
<p class="ing-list">2 teaspoons (5 g) minced garlic (about 2 medium cloves)</p>
<p class="ing-list">2 teaspoons (5 g) minced fresh ginger (about ½-inch segment)</p>
<p class="ing-list">1 scallion, minced, plus 6 to 8 scallions, white and pale green parts only, cut into 1-inch lengths</p>
<p class="ing-list">8 small dried hot chiles, such as chao tian jiao, árbol, or Japones, or ½ teaspoon hot red pepper flakes</p>
<p class="ing-ts">To Finish:</p>
<p class="ing-list">2 quarts (2 l) peanut, rice bran, or other neutral oil</p>
<p class="ing-list">Steamed rice, for serving</p>
<p class="dir"><b class="calibre2">DIRECTIONS</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="crlg">1</span> <b class="calibre2">For the Marinade and Chicken:</b> Beat the egg white in a large bowl until broken down and lightly foamy. Add the soy sauce, wine, and vodka and whisk to combine. Set aside half of the marinade in a small bowl. Add the baking soda and cornstarch to the large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the chicken to the large bowl and turn it with your fingers to coat thoroughly. Set aside while you prepare the remaining ingredients or marinate in the refrigerator up to overnight before continuing.</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_486" title="486"></span><span class="crlg">2</span> <b class="calibre2">For the Dry Coating:</b> Combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk until homogenous. Add the reserved marinade and whisk until the mixture has coarse, mealy clumps. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="crlg">3</span> <b class="calibre2">For the Sauce:</b> Combine the soy sauces and cornstarch in a medium bowl and stir with a fork until no lumps remain. Add the wine, vinegar, chicken stock, sugar, and sesame oil and stir to combine. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="crlg">4</span> Combine the oil, garlic, ginger, minced scallions, and red chiles in a large skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring, until the vegetables are aromatic and soft but not browned, about 3 minutes. Stir the sauce mixture and add to the skillet, making sure to scrape out any sugar or starch that has sunk to the bottom. Cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens, about 1 minute. Add the scallion segments. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="crlg">5</span> <b class="calibre2">To Finish:</b> Heat the oil in a wok over high heat until it registers 350°F (175°C) on an instant-read thermometer, then adjust the heat to maintain the temperature. Working one piece at a time, transfer the chicken from the marinade to the dry coating mixture, tossing after each addition to coat the chicken. When all the chicken has been added to the dry coating, toss with your hands, pressing the dry mixture onto the chicken so it adheres and making sure that every piece is coated thoroughly.</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="crlg">6</span> Lift the chicken one piece at a time, shake off the excess coating, and carefully lower it into the hot oil (do not drop it). Once all the chicken has been added, cook, agitating with long chopsticks or a spider and adjusting the heat to maintain a temperature of 325° to 350°F (160° to 175°C), until the chicken is cooked through and very crispy, about 4 minutes. Remove the chicken with a spider and transfer to a paper-towel-lined bowl to drain.</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="crlg">7</span> <b class="calibre2">Optional Double-Fry, for Extra-Crispy Results:</b> Let the chicken cool completely on the countertop, or let it rest uncovered in the fridge for up to two nights. Meanwhile, strain the oil and discard any solids. Reheat the oil to 375°F (190°C), return the chicken to the oil, and refry, agitating constantly, until crispy, about 2 minutes. Remove the chicken with a spider and transfer to a paper-towel-lined bowl to drain.</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="crlg">8</span> Add the chicken to the skillet with the sauce. Toss the chicken, folding it with a rubber spatula until all pieces are thoroughly coated. Serve immediately with rice.</p>

<p class="sbox-h">Popeye’s + Your Wok = Excellent General Tso’s</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">I want to preface this by saying this idea was not mine, and in no way can I claim credit for it. It came from a conversation I had with a <i class="calibre9">Serious Eats</i> reader in 2011, who told me that he had started making my kung pao chicken recipe, only to realize that he had no chicken at home. What he did have, on the other hand, was leftover Popeye’s chicken nuggets. So he improvised.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">The idea seemed absolutely brilliant, especially for Chinese American dishes traditionally made with fried nuggets of chicken, so I tried it. I picked up a couple boxes of Popeye’s chicken nuggets and fried shrimp, then added them directly to batches of General Tso’s, orange chicken, and sesame chicken sauces. They were terrific. Not quite as crisp as the homemade stuff, of course, but if you’re craving some of these dishes and simply don’t feel like deep frying at home, this hack may well be just the right fit for your dinner plans. Pro tip: if you <i class="calibre9">refry</i> fridge-cold leftover fried chicken (whether homemade or fast food), it comes out extra-crisp.</p>

<p class="h1">THE GENERAL’S EXTENDED FAMILY</p>
<p class="noindent_para">My high school physics teacher, Mr. Harless, always told me, “Kenji, your goal in life should be to work hard to become as lazy as you can be.” During my first semester at college, when all classes were taken on a pass/fail basis, I took him at his word by being the student in my thermodynamics class who got the lowest possible passing grade. I’m pretty sure that’s not what Mr. Harless meant, but my TA bought me a six-pack of beer for the accomplishment, so . . . thanks, Mr. Harless?</p>
<p class="indent_para">What he did mean was this: If you take the time to solve one problem, you should do your darnedest to make sure that the lessons you learn while solving it are applied to other, similar problems so that you can kill multiple birds with one stone.<sup class="calibre10"><a id="footnote-016-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0280.html#footnote-016" class="calibre6">*</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent_para">Prime example: take all the lessons I learned during months of testing recipes for General Tso’s chicken and apply them to its very similar partners-in-crime on the Chinese American lunch special menu—orange chicken, sesame chicken, Springfield-style cashew chicken, and orange peel beef.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Hey, Mr. Harless, look what I did: I can now get takeout-style Chinese American chicken dishes, and I don’t even have to pick up the phone! How’s that for lazy?</p>
<p class="line2"/>
<p class="fn-tb1"><a id="footnote-016" href="part0280.html#footnote-016-backlink" class="calibre5">*</a><span class="bull"></span>In this case, confusingly, the stone in the metaphor is actually a bird, while the birds are, in fact, saucy and crispy Chinese American dishes.</p>
