<p class="recipe_rdt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133" title="133"></span>CUMIN LAMB</p>
<p class="noindent_para">I remember the first time I had lamb with cumin. It was at New Taste of Asia, a now long-gone Sichuan restaurant in Brookline, Massachusetts. Tender strips of thinly sliced lamb coated in a lightly crunchy, intensely flavored crust, fried until it was almost dry on the exterior, yet still housing a juicy core.</p>
<p class="indent_para">The aroma had the distinct musky scent of cumin but was bound together with other, more complex flavors. A hint of Sichuan peppercorns was there—my mouth became ever so slightly numb after the first few bites—as were a handful of dried chiles, though you’d be hard pressed to call the dish spicy. <i class="calibre9">Aromatic</i> is a better term. Garlic, soy, and a big, fat bed of cilantro.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I soon started seeing it pop up in one form or another on menus all over Boston and New York, usually in Sichuan restaurants, quite often under a separate part of the menu titled “Northern Specialties” or the like.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Turns out that the dish is not exactly a Sichuan staple, at least not until recently. As <i class="calibre9">northern</i> implies, it’s a dish that originates in Xinjiang, China’s vast northwestern landlocked province that borders Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and Kyrgyzstan, among other places. One of the most ethnically diverse regions in the country, until the latter half of this century, its dominant group was the now-persecuted Turkic Uyghurs, and it is from their Muslim cuisine that the dish originates. Since then, it’s been brought deeper into China, becoming a staple of street cart vendors throughout northern China, and even to Muslim restaurants in major cities in the South and East. I even spied it on a menu in Hong Kong a couple years ago.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Its cultural background explains its unique flavor profile, but what about cooking technique? It’s clearly not a standard stir-fry. The pieces of lamb come out far drier, with a sort of crust around them. It seems to me to be more closely tied to the Sichuan method of dry-frying, a technique in which meat is par-cooked in oil until the exterior is crunchy, chewy, and dry before being reincorporated into the dish. At least it must be somewhere between dry-frying and standard stir-frying.</p>
<p class="indent_para">In Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid’s <i class="calibre9">Beyond the Great Wall</i>, a beautiful book about the cuisines of northern China and Mongolia, they offer a version they were served in a stall near the ancient Silk Road. They start by toasting cumin and garlic, adding sliced lamb, then cooking the whole thing down with bean sprouts and greens. Mark Bittman published a similar recipe in the 2008 <i class="calibre9">New York Times Diner’s Journal</i> using cubed lamb and scallions. Neither one achieved quite the level of crusty flavor I was looking for in my lamb, but both offered the good advice to use whole cumin seed and to take the time to toast them beforehand.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Toasting whole spices not only volatilizes some of their aromas, making your kitchen smell great, but it actually physically transforms some of them, effecting chemical reactions that trigger the formation of hundreds of new, aromatic compounds. Tasted side by side, the difference is undeniable. Using whole cumin (and, in my version, Sichuan peppercorn) is essential—cumin powder can’t be toasted properly, and it doesn’t give you the nice little crunchy bits that make the dish interesting to eat.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I tried cooking it using several methods, and the one that I found worked best was to stir-fry it with just a bit more oil than I’d typically use so that rather than simply searing, the meat was essentially shallow-frying.</p>
<p class="indent_para">To get the cumin flavor into the lamb, I toast the spices first, then combine them along with some garlic and a touch of soy sauce—not much—into a paste, which I then rub all over the lamb. As the lamb cooks, this paste dehydrates and chars, forming the crunchy, flavorful crust I was looking for.</p>
<p class="indent_para">The only thing left was to add a bit of heat and aroma in the form of dried roasted chiles and a couple of carefully chosen vegetables. While the sprouts and greens that Alford/Duguid use are nice, I prefer the sweetness of onions—another vegetable brought to China from Eurasia via the Silk Road—and a few stalks of crunchy celery.</p>
<p class="indent_para">And unless your family really, really loves cumin and garlic—and my wife, Adri, doesn’t—I suggest you make this dish while they are out of the house and not expected to return for the several days it takes for the awesome aromas to clear out.</p>
