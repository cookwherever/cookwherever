<section title="Acknowledgments" epub:type="backmatter" class="calibre1">
<p class="bm_h" id="sec22"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_623" title="623" class="calibre1"></span><a href="part0004.html#rsec22" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre1">acknowledgments</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent_para">This book started as a single chapter in my first book, <i class="calibre9">The Food Lab</i>, which my editor, the great Maria Guarnaschelli, very smartly suggested we cut from that manuscript—not because it wasn’t any good, but because she saw potential in it for a future project. She passed away before the manuscript for this book was finished, but her mark is all over it. I cannot write without thinking: “What would Maria say?” She was brutally honest, wickedly sharp, and, most of all, fiercely supportive and loyal, and I miss her greatly. Thank you for everything, Maria, I constantly strive to live up to the pride you showed in your writers.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I did not think that anyone could fill the enormous (and comfy) shoes left behind when Maria passed away, but working with Melanie Tortoroli has been nothing but joy. Thank you, Melanie, for putting up with me through countless changes, redirections, rewrites, and late nights, and for never being anything but supportive and understanding, no matter how many extensions I ask for. I can’t wait to get started on our next project together (more children’s books, please!).</p>
<p class="indent_para">Without great editors, designers, and artists, a book is just a messy wall of text. Thankfully, copyeditor Chris Benton and project editor Susan Sanfrey were here to get my text into shape, while designer Toni Tajima and art director Ingsu Liu made the whole thing beautiful to look at, comfortable to read, and functional to use. Thank you, Chris, Susan, Toni, and Ingsu!</p>
<p class="indent_para">Will Scarlett is a great publicist specifically because he is a genuinely great human being: Kind, caring, and enthusiastic in his work. Thank you, Will, I’ll see you on tour.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I’d like to thank my agent, Vicky Bijur, and her husband (and my former boss) Ed Levine. More than just colleagues, Vicky and Ed are better editors, advocates, cheerleaders, and friends than anyone could hope for.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of the Asian immigrants who came to the United States and brought their food and culture with them, both to those who strove to maintain that food and culture as authentically as possible and to those who embraced adapting it to Western sensibilities. Every one of their stories, both sung and unsung, are worth hearing. Thank you.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I greatly admire the pioneers of Asian cooking education on television, especially Joyce Chen, the first woman of color to host a cooking show and whose book, <i class="calibre9">The Joyce Chen Cookbook</i>, was responsible for a huge number of delicious memories from my childhood. Martin Yan’s showmanship and energetic teaching style gave me my first glimpse of what goes on behind the kitchen doors in Chinatown. As a role model for Asian American chefs and writers, Ming Tsai showed a generation of cooks the beauty of combining Asian and Western techniques and ingredients, smashing cultural stereotypes in the process. His <i class="calibre9">Blue Ginger</i> cookbook was the first book I bought with my first paycheck from my first restaurant job. It has truly blown my mind that I’ve had the opportunity to meet him since then, and he’s as kind and supportive as he seems on TV. Thank you, chef.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Grace Young’s cookbooks have inspired and enlightened me for decades, but even more inspiring is her work with uplifting the Asian American community. She is kind, caring, passionate, and tireless in her efforts to help others and to advocate on behalf of those whose voices need amplification. Thank you so much, Grace.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I’d like to thank Eileen Yin-Fei Lo; Fuchsia Dunlop; Elizabeth Andoh; Andrea Nguyen; Hooni Kim; Leela Punyarathabandhu (who volunteered her <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_624" title="624"></span>proofreading services for all of the Thai romanizations and recipes in this book); David Chang; Adam Liaw; Christopher Thomas and Stephanie Li; Namiko Chen; Mark Matsumoto; Wang Gang; Maangchi; Hyosun proofreading services for all of the Thai romanizations and recipes in this book); David Chang; Adam Liaw; Christopher Thomas and Stephanie Li; Namiko Chen; Mark Matsumoto; Wang Gang; Maangchi; Hyosun Ro; Pailin Chongchitnat; Elaine from China Sichuan Food; Bill, Judy, Sarah, and Kaitlin from <i class="calibre9">The Woks of Life</i>; Brandon Jew; Irene Kuo; Irene, Margaret, and Andrew Li; Pim Techumvit; Alvin Cailan; Leah Cohen; Mandy Lee; and countless others for their work in celebrating and teaching Asian cuisine to Western audiences. Their books, columns, shows, and videos are the first places I turn when I have questions about Asian cookery. They are insanely generous with their time and knowledge and cooks around the world benefit from it. Thank you to every one of you, and the many others I missed.</p>
<p class="indent_para">My grandmother Yasuko was the kindest, funniest grandmother a kid could ask for. She, without my even noticing it, instilled in me a sense of Japanese-ness that only later in life, after her passing, did I realize was a foundational element of my own sense of self. My grandfather Koji taught me that you can be serious about your work without being too serious about life, and that it’s really hard to work on something if you’re not having fun doing it. Thank you, Kachan and Jita.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I want to thank my father, Fred, whose love of Chinese, Thai, and Mexican food is unparalleled. From my early childhood days scouring New York’s Chinatown with him for great Cantonese food, to seeking out the best Sichuan cuisine in the suburbs of Boston, to introducing me to the secret Thai-language menu at Monsoon, his passion for great food is paralleled only by his passion for science (and fishing). Thanks, Fred.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I want to thank my sisters, Aya and Pico, whose love of Chinese food trails only behind Fred’s. I tested and wrote a lot of these recipes for you, and I expect detailed reports back on exactly how the chow fun is not as good as at Kwok Wah, and why the Pepper and Salty Shrimp can’t live up to the legendary version at Phoenix Garden (it’s not and they can’t). Thanks Poojack, thanks Bub.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I want to thank my mother, Keiko, for the years of tireless work she put into raising me and my sisters, for always being present in our lives, for making sure that we had dinner as a family nearly every single night (if it wasn’t home-cooked it was take-out Chinese or pizza), and for walking that difficult tightrope of raising Japanese American kids as a first-generation immigrant. Thanks, ma.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I want to thank Alicia for all her help and patience through the process of writing this book, which has been in progress since she was born. She was a wonderful assistant photographer (if you see a photo in this book with my hands in it, that was my daughter behind the camera pushing the shutter release!), a voracious taste tester, a truly helpful kitchen assistant, and a wonderful cheerleader (yes, Alicia, I <i class="calibre9">finally</i> finished the noodle chapter.) I am blown away and inspired every day by what a smart, funny, thoughtful, and caring a human she is turning into. Thank you, Alicia.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I want to thank Koji who, even in the womb, inspired me to want to do better. Thanks, Wombat.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Most of all I want to thank my wife, Adri, who, despite knowing what writing a book involves, supported me through it all once again, this time while juggling a job, a toddler, and a pregnancy. She not only makes me want to be the best version of myself I can be, but she helps me figure out what that is and how to get there, and I love her. Thank you, Adri.</p>
