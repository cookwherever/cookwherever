<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">What are the best clams for stir-fries?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Whether farmed or wild, clams are among the most sustainable (and delicious!) forms of seafood you can eat. When shopping for clams for stir-fries, the most important quality is freshness. You should be buying only live clams. Once dead, their slightly bitter flavor tends to go south extremely fast. Live clams will either be stored in running saltwater tanks (what you’ll find at a larger Chinese fish market), or in mesh bags on ice (as is common in Western supermarkets). Depending on what part of the country you’re in, you are likely to find a few different types of clams. Here are my recommendations for stir-fries:</p>
<div class="bullet-listy">
<p class="sarrowy"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="red1">Littlenecks, topnecks, or cherrystones:</span> These are all species of the same hard-shelled clam, known as <i class="calibre9">quahogs (</i>pronounced ko-hog, from the Narraganset word <i class="calibre9">poquahock</i>) in New England. Littlenecks are the smallest, followed by topnecks and cherrystones. They have very hard, pale gray to beige shells and a clean, briny, sweet flavor.</p>
<p class="sarrowy"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="red1">Manila clams</span> resemble quahogs but have shells that are a bit thinner and range in color from beige to reddish brown. Their flavor is a little sweeter and less salty than that of quahogs.</p>
<p class="sarrowy"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="red1">Cockles</span> are small bivalves that range across the entire globe. You’ll find cockles on both coasts, as well as farmed cockles imported from New Zealand. They are generally smaller than quahogs or Manila clams and cook about 30 percent faster than either.</p>
<p class="sarrowy"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="red1">Atlantic razor clams,</span> so called because of their resemblance to a folded barber’s razor blade, have long, thin, brittle shells and long siphons that extend past their bodies, which never fully close. You can find them live at fish markets in the Northeast, though it’s rare to find them outside of that region. They have deliciously tender, sweet flesh without the bitterness that quahogs and Manilas can have. If you have access to them, snatch them up; they’re a real treat. Do not confuse them with Pacific razor clams, which are much larger and are not particularly well suited for stir-fries (though they are delicious breaded and fried).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">How should I store clams when I bring them home?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> The best thing to do with live clams is to cook them the day you buy them! If you must store them, keep them in an open container in the refrigerator. Do not wrap them tightly or put them in a plastic bag, which can suffocate them and lead to an early demise. In the fridge, healthy clams should last for a couple of days.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">How can I tell if my clams are still good to eat?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Live quahogs, Manila clams, and cockles will typically gape slightly in the fridge or be very gently closed. The easiest way to check if they’re still alive is to give them a little squeeze and see if they, well, clam up. They should close fully and tightly. Razor clams, which never close, should react when you touch their siphons, retracting away from your finger.</p>
<p class="box_parain">If your clams are already tightly shut, they are most likely perfectly fine to eat. So long as they smell fresh and briny, go ahead and cook them (dead clams will give off more distinctly fishy aromas). Even clams that don’t open when cooked are fine to eat, provided they smell alright.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154" title="154"></span><span class="dropcap">Q</span> <i class="calibre9">Do I need to purge clams?</i></p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> While not strictly necessary, purging clams by letting them soak in cold salty water before cooking them is typically a good idea. First, it gives them a chance to spit out any grit that might be contained within their shells (sometimes a significant amount). Second, it ensures that they have plenty of moisture in them to expel during cooking, which helps them steam and cook evenly.</p>
<p class="box_parain">To purge clams, first make a 2½ percent brine: for every liter of water, add 25 grams of salt (that’s 3 tablespoons Diamond Crystal kosher, 2 tablespoons Morton’s kosher, or 1½ tablespoons table salt per liter). Submerge the clams in this brine and refrigerate them for half an hour. Check the bottom of the bowl for any grit. Drain and repeat the process until the bowl is clean.</p>
