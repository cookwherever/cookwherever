<p class="recipe_rdt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_234" title="234"></span>GYUDON</p>
<p class="noindent_para">You know that scene at the beginning of <i class="calibre9">Saturday Night Fever</i> where John Travolta orders a couple of slices of pizza from a sidewalk window, stacks them on top of each other, gives them the New York fold, and struts down the street, meal in hand? That is a scene you are unlikely to see in Japan, and it’s not because disco wasn’t popular (it was) or because Japanese people have a thing against John Travolta (they don’t) or even because they don’t love pizza (they do).</p>
<p class="indent_para">The issue is the whole walking-while-eating thing. It just doesn’t happen in Japan. Going to the 7-Eleven to pick up some pizza-flavored steamed buns? You’re taking them home before you dig in. Hitting up Starbucks for a coffee? You’re standing there and finishing the coffee before you step back out on the street.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Because of this, traditional fast-food culture in Japan is quite different from that of the United States. Fewer sandwiches and handheld snacks; more hastily slurped or shoveled bowls of food. All this is changing as cultural exchange with the West increases, of course, but ramen, curry, and rice bowls still remain staples of the quick-dining scene.</p>
<p class="indent_para"><i class="calibre9">Gyudon</i> was popularized by Yoshinoya, a chain of fast-food rice bowl restaurants that now have an international presence. They’ve been serving the dish since 1899, making gyudon one of the oldest continuously served fast-food menu items still available today, if not <i class="calibre9">the</i> oldest, predating the hamburger by several decades. Head into any Japanese shopping-mall food court and I guarantee gyudon will be on the menu.</p>
<p class="indent_para">What’s fantastic is that it’s also incredibly easy to make at home, requiring only a single pan and virtually no experience or skill whatsoever. If you can boil water, you can make gyudon.</p>
<p class="indent_para">There are a couple of keys to good gyudon. First is getting the beef. It’s typically made with rib eye or chuck that’s been shaved extra thin on a meat slicer. You’ll be able to find good meat for gyudon at Japanese supermarkets, but if you don’t have access to that, any beef intended for Philly cheesesteaks will work (even the frozen stuff!). If your local supermarket has a butcher department that will slice rare roast beef to order, ask them to slice it as thin as they possibly can and use that for your gyudon (it’s OK that it’s already partially cooked).</p>
<p class="indent_para">Alternatively, you can buy a chuck steak, place it in the freezer until it’s very firm but not frozen solid, then slice it as thin as you can with a knife. It’s OK if the meat ends up shredding a bit. Perfection is not what we’re going for here.</p>
<p class="indent_para">The rest of the dish is very similar to oyakodon. Simmer the onions in a soy-dashi-sake-mirin broth, add the meat, and simmer a bit more. If you like daikon radish, a few slices of daikon added with the onions are also excellent.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Because the beef is so thinly sliced, it will cook very quickly, losing its red color almost instantly. The goal is to cook it all down until the broth reduces to an intensely flavored sauce that penetrates the meat. With a typical braise, this can take hours. With the thinly shaved beef in gyudon, it takes just a couple of minutes. I like to stir in some grated ginger during the last minute or so of simmering, which preserves some of the ginger’s fresh heat.</p>
<p class="indent_para">At Yoshinoya, they top their gyudon with a little pile of bright red <i class="calibre9">beni-shoga</i> (red-pickled ginger) and a sprinkle of togarashi. I’ve never met a bowl of gyudon that couldn’t be improved with a runny poached egg and a handful of sliced scallions either.</p>
<p class="indent_para">If you want to go all in, do it the Japanese way, with a raw egg broken on top and stirred in, tamago-kake gohan style. It’s not for everyone, so I’ll understand if you want to pass on it. I’ll judge you only about as much as I judge people who don’t like sauerkraut on their hot dogs.</p>
