<p class="noindent_para">If you’ve ever been to a P. F. Chang’s (which serves food that is honestly much better than any massive shopping mall chain has any right to be), you’re familiar with a version of <i class="calibre9">san choi bao</i>—lettuce wraps. I grew up eating a variation of the dish at the original Phoenix Garden in New York’s Chinatown, a now-shuttered Cantonese restaurant that burned down twice during its decades of service. As opposed to the sort of gloopy version served at P. F. Chang’s, Phoenix Garden’s featured minced squab stir-fried with pine nuts and finely diced water chestnuts and vegetables in a way that allowed each piece to remain distinct. You spread a little hoisin sauce in the bottom of a piece of ice-cold iceberg lettuce, pile some of the loose mixture into it, and eat it with your hands like a taco. This thing is all about texture as the mix of crunchy, crisp, and tender bits comes together in your mouth.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Despite the fact that it says “squab” on the menu, and I trust that they were, in fact, using squab (the price certainly justified it), I never actually get much squab flavor out of the mix. You could tell me it’s chicken or pork or tofu, and I wouldn’t think to contest it. As in many Chinese dishes, the meat isn’t the star; it’s just a bit player, there to add texture that complements the vegetables. That’s good news: it means you can use diced chicken, pork, or even firm or extra-firm tofu without any real sacrifice.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Nearly every recipe in this book starts with a marinade, but this one doesn’t. The small dice cook quickly and are small enough that the flavor of the sauce nicely coats them, even without a flavorful marinade.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Typically san choi bao uses water chestnuts for crunch. I love water chestnuts—they have a satisfyingly crisp texture that stays crisp even after cooking. Fresh water chestnuts are difficult to find (and mildly annoying to prepare), but the canned water chestnuts my mom threw into our stir-fries growing up work just fine. That said, I prefer working with fresh ingredients whenever I can. One afternoon, as I was wandering the aisles of my local Latin produce shop, I saw a pile of jícama and realized that the texture of jícama is actually very similar to that of water chestnut. Diced into a stir-fry, it has the same watery crunch and mild flavor and has become my go-to vegetable for dishes that call for water chestnuts. (I still keep a couple cans of water chestnuts around in case I can’t find jícama.)</p>
<p class="indent_para">The remaining ingredients are straightforward: diced celery for more crunch and flavor, pine nuts toasted slowly in oil until deep golden brown, some diced shiitake mushrooms, some garlic, ginger, and scallions for aroma, and fresh cilantro leaves to finish it off. For the sauce, I use a sweet-and-savory mix of Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, black or Chinkiang vinegar (balsamic works, too), and a very light touch of cornstarch.</p>
<p class="indent_para">The finished dish is a powerhouse of textures and flavors, with a great mix of crisp, tender, fresh, and nutty. I serve it with chilled iceberg lettuce—you can also use green leaf if you’re one of those folks who, for whatever reason, can’t abide iceberg—which I spread with a little extra hoisin sauce before spooning in the mixture. Inevitably I overstuff, which makes eating it a messy affair, but getting messy is half the fun, isn’t it?</p>
