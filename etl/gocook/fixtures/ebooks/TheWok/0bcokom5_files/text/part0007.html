<p class="h" id="fm1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2" title="2"></span>Meet the Most Versatile Pan in Your Kitchen</p>
<p class="noindent_paraav">Since writing my first book, <i class="calibre9">The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science</i>, a lot of things have changed. I spent several years living in San Mateo, California, before moving to Seattle. I now have a normal-sized American kitchen though I dearly miss my small, extraordinarily functional New York galley-style kitchen (I actually have to <i class="calibre9">walk</i> between my counter and my stovetop, much to my chagrin). I’m something called a “YouTube Creator” and an “influencer.” I’ve got kids!<sup class="calibre10"><a id="footnote-066-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0007.html#footnote-066" class="calibre6">*</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent_para">All of these factors mean that fast, fresh cooking is the order of the day, and that’s why I reach for my wok more than any other pan in my kitchen.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Do you know the principle of Chekhov’s gun? It’s a basic rule in good storytelling coined by Russian playwright Anton Chekhov that states that if a loaded gun is introduced to the story, it had better go off before you reach the end.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Dear readers, I apologize, for I broke this rule in <i class="calibre9">The Food Lab.</i> My Chekhov’s gun? <b class="calibre2">The wok.</b> Despite spending two pages expounding on its usefulness, despite declaring that it is the most commonly used pan in my home kitchen, I failed to provide a single recipe for it.<sup class="calibre10"><a id="footnote-065-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0007.html#footnote-065" class="calibre6">†</a></sup> Here I intend to fix that. By the end of this book, not only will you be firing out delicious recipes from your wok left and right; you’ll have learned the skills required to throw together a meal using virtually any meat, vegetable, or plant-based protein source you find in your fridge, whether you have a lazy afternoon to cook or a harried half hour while simultaneously handling a toddler.</p>
<p class="indent_para">As far as putting dinner on the table quickly and easily, <i class="calibre9">nothing</i> beats stir-frying in a wok. It’s the quintessential weeknight supper. Because the actual cooking is so fast, it’s also an ideal summer meal—no heating up the house with a hot oven or a long-simmering pot. It’s also a fantastic way to showcase good ingredients. Vegetables retain their bright color and crunch, proteins come out tender and flavor-packed.</p>
<p class="indent_para">And there’s no reason to stick with just Asian ingredients! Asparagus, corn, zucchini, string beans, peas, fava beans, almost any firm vegetable you can think of makes for wonderful stir-fries. The Asian American restaurant staples of beef, pork, chicken, and shrimp are also only the tip of the iceberg. Firm fish and shellfish are prime stir-fry candidates, as are tofu, seitan, and other vegetarian protein sources.</p>
<p class="indent_para">But it doesn’t end there! The wok is also the ideal vessel for deep frying at home (good-bye, stovetop splatter); you can use it to steam vegetables, dumplings, and, well, anything steamable; it doubles as an indoor quick-smoker (home-smoked cheese! Home-smoked duck! Home-smoked whiskey!); and it’s great for stovetop-braising meats and vegetables.</p>
<p class="indent_para">When it comes to producing quick, flavorful, and versatile meals, the wok beats every other pan in the kitchen, hands down.</p>
<p class="h" id="fm2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3" title="3"></span>Wok History</p>
<p class="noindent_para">There are plenty of other books that talk about the history of the wok. I’m a cook with a penchant for science, not a historian, so I see no reason to go into great detail here when other people already do it so much better.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Long story short: The origins of the wok are unclear, but in all likelihood it was introduced to China from a neighboring country sometime during the Han Dynasty (right around the BC to AD changeover) as a clay vessel, designed for drying grains. By the Ming Dynasty, around seven hundred years ago, metal woks used for stir-frying were popularized and have gone on to become the most common cooking method throughout the country.</p>
<p class="indent_para">My own introduction to the wok was during the MacGyver dynasty (right around the eighties-to-nineties changeover) as an infomercial, designed for selling kitchen gadgets. By the MacGyver reboot dynasty, it had gone on to become the most common cooking method throughout my kitchen.</p>
<p class="indent_para">“It’s The Great Wok of China!” exclaims Arnold Morris in the middle of his half-hour infomercial. The late 1980s were prime infomercial time, and, along with Mr. Wizard’s World and He-Man, they were a staple of my childhood viewing. I loved all those kitchen gadgets, but even then I could see through most of them as a gimmick. Ron Popeil’s Chop-o-Matic (“The greatest kitchen appliance ever made!”<sup class="calibre10"><a id="footnote-064-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0007.html#footnote-064" class="calibre6">‡</a></sup>), Veg-o-Matic (“Slice tomatoes so thin they only have one side!”<sup class="calibre10"><a id="footnote-063-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0007.html#footnote-063" class="calibre6">§</a></sup>), and Showtime Rotisserie (“Set it and . .  .” you can finish the rest, I’m sure) captured my attention, but not my curiosity. But that hand-hammered wok!</p>
<p class="indent_para">I was familiar with woks growing up. My mother, who moved to the United States from Japan in her late teens, had a small carbon-steel number that she used for deep frying gyoza and Japanese-style croquettes or for making fried rice and Chungking Pork (check out <a href="part0037.html#page_95" class="calibre5">here</a> for my updated version of her recipe). But it was through one of those infomercials that I really started getting curious about the wok.</p>
<p class="indent_para">My current wok is the same one that I’ve used since buying it in the early 2000s. The quality of my relationship with it is only barely bested by that with my wife, my daughter, and <i class="calibre9">some</i> members of my extended family.</p>
<p class="indent_para">If you are ready to start down the path of your own lifelong commitment to an inanimate object, then read on.</p>

<p class="sbox-h">Why Technique over Recipes?</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Don’t get me wrong—there are plenty of recipes in this book, and if you’re the type who just wants to follow instructions and leave the planning to someone else, that’s totally fine. I promise, the recipes will work for you. But if, on the other hand, you have that desire to be in charge of your own destiny, to cook that meal that’s custom-suited for future you, then I hope you’ll find the lengthy in-between-the-recipes sections of this book even more interesting.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">I like to think of cooking as a map. Following a recipe is like getting turn-by-turn instructions, your face buried in your smartphone. Sure, with good recipes, you can get from point A (raw ingredients) to point B (delicious meals), and sometimes that’s all you want. But learning the science and technique behind those recipes! That’s like being given an atlas. It’s full access to all of Google maps, from the biggest bird’s-eye view to the details on each street.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">With that map at your disposal, you may find a better, more efficient way to get from A to B, custom-suited to your cooking style or kitchen. You may, in fact, find that you’d rather go to B-prime, or maybe even points X, Y, or Z. Sometimes you might plan on going from A to B but find you’re up against a roadblock. You’re missing one of the ingredients in the list, or perhaps a piece of equipment. No problem. Armed with that map, with those techniques and science, you’ll be able to find an alternate route with ease.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">If you’re just starting out, I’m not gonna kid you, it’s gonna take some learning and some commitment. But it’s the <i class="calibre9">fun</i> kind of learning, and as long as you have a commitment to mapo tofu or tempura, you’re going to do just fine.</p>

<p class="h" id="fm3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4" title="4"></span>Buying a Wok</p>
<p class="noindent_para">Woks come in as many shapes, sizes, and materials as Western-style sauté pans and saucepots, but here is my quick and dirty recommendation for anyone who cooks on a standard Western-style range: get yourself a 14-inch, flat-bottomed, carbon steel wok made with material around 2 mm (14 gauge) thick, with a single long handle and a helper-handle on the opposite side. If you happen to live in a city with a sizable Chinese population, your best bet is to hit up a Chinese restaurant supply store. You’ll find a variety of woks at really great prices. The Wok Shop in San Francisco’s Chinatown has been selling high quality woks for over fifty years. You can browse and order them from wokshop.com.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Want a little more detail? OK, here we go.</p>
<p class="h1" id="fm4">WOK MATERIALS</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> What metallurgical qualities are important when selecting a wok?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Woks come in a variety of materials, thicknesses, and finishes. There are four important qualities to consider in the material for your wok. The first three (specific heat capacity, density, and conductivity) are physical properties of the material itself, while the third (reactivity) is a function of a wok’s material, thickness, and geometry. For now we’ll focus on the first two.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1">Specific heat capacity</span> is the amount of energy it takes to raise a specific amount of material a specific number of degrees. In metric, this is measured in kilojoules per kilogram per kelvin. For instance, aluminum has a specific heat of .91. That means that it takes .91 kilojoule of energy to raise 1 kilogram of aluminum by 1 kelvin (about 2°F for those who are imperially inclined). Conversely, this means that for every kelvin a kilogram of aluminum is at, it has 1 kilojoule of energy to give up either to the surrounding environment or the food in the pan. Cast iron, with a heat capacity of .46, holds about half as much energy as aluminum per unit weight. This means that given identical weights and starting temperatures, an aluminum pan will contain about twice as much heat energy as a cast iron pan. This gets more complicated when you take into account density.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1">The density</span> of a material is the ratio of weight to size. Aluminum has a density of 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter, whereas cast iron has a density of 7.2. This means that given two pans of identical shape and size, a cast iron pan will weigh about 2.5 times more than an aluminum pan. Thus even though cast iron holds about half as much heat energy per unit weight, given identical shapes and sizes, a cast iron pan will hold about 1.25 times as much heat energy as an aluminum pan. These two concepts, heat capacity and density, can be combined into a more useful concept: volumetric heat capacity.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1">Volumetric heat capacity</span> is a measure of how much heat energy a given volume of a material will store, given a specific temperature. Conversely, it’s also a measure of how much energy you need to add to a fixed volume of material to raise that material’s temperature by a fixed number of degrees.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Sound confusing? Here’s an easy way to think of it. Every pan in your kitchen acts as a sort of reservoir or bucket of energy. Preheating a pan on a burner is sort of like pouring water into that bucket. The higher the volumetric heat capacity of the pan, the bigger that bucket, the longer it takes to fill up, and the more energy it will hold. A cast iron wok is a heat-storing bucket about 1.25 times (25 percent) bigger than an aluminum wok of the same shape and size.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1">Conductivity</span> is a material’s ability to get heat from one area to another. This applies to its ability to efficiently conduct heat from the heat source to the food, but also to its ability to conduct heat evenly throughout its cooking surface. Conductivity is more or less linear: it will take about twice as long for a 2-millimeter-thick pan to conduct heat from the burner to the food than a 1-millimeter-thick pan.</p>

<p class="box_parain"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5" title="5"></span>If we go back to that bucket analogy, you can think of conductivity as the size of the spigot at the bottom of the bucket. The higher the conductivity, the bigger the spigot, and the faster you can pour energy from inside the bucket into the food you are cooking.</p>
<p class="box_parain">If we were to look purely at heat capacity and conductivity, aluminum is the clear winner here. It stores plenty of heat (nothing has it beat!) and transfers energy quickly (only copper is more conductive). However, aluminum hits a snag in the density department. Because it is so light, you’d need a ludicrously thick aluminum pan to achieve the <i class="calibre9">volumetric</i> heat capacity of carbon or stainless steel.</p>
<p class="box_parain">In other words, all else being equal, a 2-millimeter-thick carbon steel pan will hold about 60 percent more energy at a given temperature than a 2-millimeter-thick aluminum pan, though an aluminum pan will be about four times more conductive.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> So what about this reactivity thing?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> <span class="red1">Reactivity</span> is a pan’s ability to react quickly to changes in heat input. If I switch off the heat, do the contents of the pan continue to sizzle and sweat, or do they cool rapidly? If I need a quick blast of heat, does the wok react fast enough when I turn the dial up?</p>
<p class="box_parain">With a Western-style pan, we typically value consistency over reactivity. We want the pan to maintain a slow, steady sizzle as we add finely diced vegetables to sauté, and we want it to maintain a vigorous sizzle as we sear. Rarely in Western cuisine do you find yourself needing to go from a simmer to a sear to a gentle bubble in the course of a few moments. With wok cooking, this is a frequent occurrence.</p>
<p class="box_parain">This quality is related to the conductivity of a wok’s material (the more conductive the more reactive) and its thickness (the thinner the more reactive), but more importantly, the geometry of your wok and how it fits with your burner can have a big impact. Ideally, your wok should fit over your hottest burner with a wide enough flat-bottomed area that the ring of flames heats <i class="calibre9">mostly</i> the bottom with a little bit of flame riding up the flared sides. This maximizes reactivity in the center of the pan, where you need it the most.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> OK, so give it to me: Which material should I choose?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> <span class="red1">Stainless steel</span> woks are expensive, heavy, difficult to maneuver, and not very reactive. The finish on stainless steel is also designed to be fully cleaned after each use, whereas a wok, like an old-fashioned cast iron pan, should develop a dark patina over time that improves its functionality. I would not recommend a stainless steel wok unless you use your wok primarily for braising.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1">Clad stainless steel</span> (stainless steel with a layer of aluminum or copper sandwiched in between) is even worse for woks. The layers of bonded metal expand and contract at different rates when heated, so preheating a clad pan to extreme temperatures (as woks frequently are) can cause the metal to split and the layers to separate.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6" title="6"></span>Likewise, solid <span class="red1">copper</span> woks, with their steel or tin lining, are a waste of money for the same reason (an even bigger waste—copper is significantly more expensive than steel!)</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1">Aluminum</span> distributes heat very evenly, which is a desirable characteristic for Western cooking, but not so much for wok cooking, where distinct cooking zones with different heat levels is desirable. Aluminum, with its low density, does not retain heat very well for a given wok thickness.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1">Cast iron</span> is a common traditional material, and while it has decent performance stats, its brittleness requires it to be rather thick and heavy in order not to crack or break with regular use. This makes for a heavy, cumbersome wok that isn’t very reactive.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1">Carbon steel</span> is your best bet. Modern carbon steel pans are made of spun steel that is quite durable and unlikely to crack or break. A 14-gauge pan (about 2 millimeters thick) is thick enough to store a good amount of energy for searing, but thin enough that it will react to changes in burner input quickly. It’s extremely inexpensive, and when properly used it will end up with a practically nonstick surface.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> What about nonstick woks?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Most nonstick coatings will begin to break down at around 450°F, and by 650°F they are actively decomposing into toxic vapors. Most should not be heated above 450°F or so. This is an inadequate temperature range for many stir-fries, which rely on higher heat to rapidly cook foods while preserving their color and texture. Moreover, with a nonstick wok you will achieve no <i class="calibre9">wok hei</i>—the smoky flavor you find in many restaurant-style dishes. Finally, nonstick surfaces are simply <i class="calibre9">too</i> nonstick for effective wok cooking. A small amount of sticking allows you to push food up the sides of the wok to clear space for new ingredients. Avoid nonstick woks.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1" id="fm5">WOK DESIGN</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> Round-bottom woks are more authentic than flat-bottom woks, right? Which do you recommend?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> When it comes to stir-frying at home, flat-bottom woks make the wokin’ world go round (er, go flat, that is).</p>
<p class="box_parain">Traditional woks have a deep bowl shape designed to fit into a circular opening directly over the hearth. Most modern home ranges both in the United States and in Asia are designed for flat skillets. Unless you have a custom wok insert in your range, you want to avoid round-bottom or induction woks. They won’t work, period, on an electric range, and are tough to use on a gas range—even with one of those wok rings that elevate it and hold it steady. These rings typically raise your wok too high above the heat source. Rather than absorbing all the heat, a lot of it is dissipated or gets deflected away as it travels up from the burner to the sides of the wok. On the other hand, woks with bottoms that are too flat defeat the purpose of a wok, making it tough to flip properly and to move food in and out of the high-heat zone.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Your best bet is a wok with a 4- to 5-inch flattened area at the bottom, with gently sloping sides that flare out to between 12 and 14 inches. This will give you plenty of high-heat space for searing meats and vegetables at the bottom, while still providing ample volume and room to maneuver when flipping.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7" title="7"></span><span class="dropcap">Q</span> I’ve seen woks with long handles and short handles. Which style should I get?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Cantonese-style woks have two ear-shaped looped metal handles welded or riveted onto either side. Northern-style woks, also known as <i class="calibre9">pow</i> woks, have a single long handle and, frequently, a loop-shaped helper-handle on the opposite side. Either style works, but Northern-style long-handled woks tend to be easier for folks who are used to Western-style long-handled skillets.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> So what about those hand-hammered woks from those eighties infomercials? How important is it that a wok be hand-hammered?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Woks are made in three ways. Traditional <span class="red1">hand-hammered</span> woks are an excellent choice. The slight indentations left by the hammering pattern allow you to push cooked food to the sides of the pan while adding ingredients to the center without their slipping. The only problem is that it can be difficult (perhaps impossible?) to find a hand-hammered wok with a flat bottom and a handle.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1">Stamped</span> woks are made by cutting out a circular piece of thin carbon steel and machine-pressing it into a mold. They are extremely cheap, but completely smooth, which makes it difficult to stir-fry properly in them. They are, without fail, made from low-gauge steel and prone to developing hot and cold spots, as well as feeling flimsy.</p>
<p class="box_parain"><span class="red1">Spun</span> woks are produced on a lathe, giving them a distinct pattern of concentric circles. This pattern offers the same advantages as a hand-hammered wok, allowing you to easily keep your food in place against the side of the pan. Spun woks can be found in heavy gauges, with flat bottoms, and with flip-friendly handles.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Fortunately, both spun woks and hand-hammered woks are inexpensive.</p>
</div>
<p class="h" id="fm6">Seasoning, Cleaning, and Maintaining a Wok</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> OK, I’ve got my new carbon steel wok. It’s kinda dull gray and looks like it’s coated in oil. What do I need to do to start using it?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Just like with a good cast iron or carbon steel pan, a carbon steel wok’s performance will improve the more you use it. Most come with a protective film of oil on them to prevent them from rusting or tarnishing in the store, but it’s important to remove this layer before using it the first time. First, scrub the wok out with hot, soapy water and dry it carefully. Next, heat up every metal surface over the flame of a gas burner, slowly rotating the pan until it starts to discolor and turn dark brown or black all over. If all you’ve got is an electric burner, you can achieve this process with a propane or butane torch or over an outdoor grill. This will vaporize any remaining machine oil and get your wok ready for its first layer of seasoning. Finally, give the entire thing another scrub with soapy water, dry it carefully, and rub the surface inside and out with a very light coating of oil (whatever high heat-friendly neutral oil you like to use, such as canola, grapeseed, rice bran, or peanut) using a paper towel held in tongs.</p>
<p class="box_parain">After use, avoid scrubbing the wok unless absolutely necessary. Usually, a rinse and a rubdown with a soft sponge are all that’s needed. Purists may tell you not to use soap; I do, and my wok is still well seasoned and completely nonstick. Once it’s rinsed, dry the wok with a kitchen towel or paper towels and rub some vegetable oil into the surface to give it a vapor-proof coating that will prevent it from rusting.</p>
</div>

<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> So how do I season it, and do I really need to?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Meat proteins can form direct chemical bonds with raw iron or steel. This is not good if you don’t want your wok to look like a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8" title="8"></span>stucco wall after cooking in it. Just as with a cast iron or carbon steel pan, seasoning your wok and keeping it well seasoned will prevent this, but there is a fundamental difference between seasoning a wok and seasoning a Western skillet. It’s important to understand the two different products of heating an oiled piece of ferrous material. The first product is black oxide, a reaction that occurs on the surface of the metal, causing it to turn black. The second is the formation of a layer of polymers as oil breaks down with heat.</p>
<p class="box_parain">In a Western skillet, this formation of polymers in increasingly thick layers is what gives it its nonstick properties, and those layers should generally be maintained. With a wok, it’s possible to build up those layers as well, but many cooking techniques (such as braising or even rapidly adjusting the heat during a stir-fry) will cause those layers of polymers to break down or flake off. This is OK. The seasoning in a wok mainly comes down to that layer of black oxide, and that layer can be built with each use. With proper preheating and technique, even an omelet should slip and slide without a thick layer of polymers coating the wok.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Some people recommend rigorous extended processes for building up black oxide and polymers, but I suggest you can do it the way I do it: after that initial rubdown with oil, just cook in the darn thing. Stick to relatively dry stir-fries and deep frying for the first several uses to ensure that a decent layer of seasoning has built up. Once your pan is black and shiny, you can safely steam, braise, simmer, or smoke in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> Wow, my wok is so well seasoned! Thanks! Now how do I keep this lustrous beauty lustrous and beautiful?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> There’s really not much to it. After you’re done cooking, clean your wok. This is easiest to do when the wok is still hot and it only takes a matter of seconds. A light scrub with a bamboo brush, a little soap, and water is all it takes. Don’t worry; modern soaps are quite mild and will only remove oils without affecting your polymerized seasoning or black oxide.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Once your wok is clean, dry it carefully. Water is the enemy of carbon steel and cast iron, and you don’t want it rusting on you. Next, set it over a burner and heat it up empty until every drop of moisture is gone from every part of its surface. Finally, rub it with a little fresh oil using a paper towel to protect it. The thinnest layer is all you want, to prevent your wok from getting sticky. I like to rub oil into it, then pretend I made a mistake and try to wipe off as much oil as I can with a paper towel.</p>
</div>
<p class="h" id="fm7">Wok Accessories</p>
<p class="noindent_para">The round shape of a wok is not designed for straight, narrow Western cooking implements. So you’ll need to outfit your new wok with a couple of inexpensive tools. Here are my recommendations, in order of importance.</p>
<div class="bullet-list">
<p class="bullet"><span class="red-bl">•</span><span class="bull"></span>The most important tool is a <span class="red1"><i class="calibre9">chuan</i>, or spatula</span>. These spatulas have a wide head and a gently curved lip designed to fit snugly with your wok, allowing you to easily pick up and flip large quantities of food with minimal effort. Look for spatulas at least 14 inches long made from steel or wood. You can order them online for about $10 apiece.</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="red-bl">•</span><span class="bull"></span><span class="red1">Plenty of bowls</span> for mise en place. Cooking in a wok is a fast process, but most wok-cooked dishes use more ingredients than your average Western recipe, which means a collection of small bowls for prepared ingredients and sauces is absolutely essential to successful wok cooking. No need to get fancy—I keep a large stack of little metal and ceramic bowls from the restaurant supply shop. They nest and stack, take up very little storage space, and are indestructible (this is important when you inevitably toss a bowl across the kitchen toward the sink after emptying it into your wok).</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="red-bl">•</span><span class="bull"></span>A <span class="red1">bamboo brush</span> is the best tool for scrubbing out your wok (or even your Western skillets) and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9" title="9"></span>can be found inexpensively online or at any Asian supermarket.</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="red-bl">•</span><span class="bull"></span>A <span class="red1">wire-mesh spider</span> is essential for deep frying or simmering. I like a stainless steel spider with a basket on the larger side—between 5 and 6 inches—to make it easy to tend to little nuggets of fried chicken or a big mess of noodles.</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="red-bl">•</span><span class="bull"></span>A couple of <span class="red1">bamboo steamer baskets</span> will convert your wok to a multilevel steamer (and they make for great serving vessels as well). I’d recommend a couple of 10- or 12-inch baskets. They’re designed to stack, so you can always order another if you find that two isn’t enough for your steaming needs.</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="red-bl">•</span><span class="bull"></span>A <span class="red1">lid</span> is not strictly necessary, but it makes tasks that require trapping vapor—such as braising or smoking—easier. You can always use the lid from a large saucepan to cover your wok. Because a wok has tapered sides, pretty much any lid with a diameter less than that of the wok will work. It does not need to fit perfectly.</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="red-bl">•</span><span class="bull"></span>In restaurants, you may see Chinese chefs using a <span class="red1">wide ladle called a <i class="calibre9">hoak</i></span> to add splashes of various sauces to serve soupier dishes, or to break up clumps of rice or noodles when stir-frying. I personally don’t find a hoak to be particularly useful in a home setting, where you’ll have already measured and mixed your sauces and will be cooking in batches intended to be served all at once instead of ladled out piece-meal. For times when you really need one, a Western ladle will do just fine.</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="red-bl">•</span><span class="bull"></span>A <span class="red1">Japanese-style mandoline</span> will make certain difficult bits of knifework much, much easier. In particular a mandoline is great for making the initial cuts for julienned vegetables, such as the carrots for Sichuan Dry-Fried Beef (<a href="part0243.html#page_436a" class="calibre5">here</a>) or the ginger matchsticks in Gong Bao Ji Ding (<a href="part0018.html#page_64" class="calibre5">here</a>). I use the standard model from Benriner, an inexpensive Japanese brand that is razor-sharp, has minimal moving parts (fancier models with lots of mechanical bits tend to fail pretty quickly), and is infinitely adjustable with a simple screw. It also comes with julienne attachments, though using them drastically increases the odds of injury (I speak from experience).</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="red-bl">•</span><span class="bull"></span><span class="red1">Small plastic squeeze bottles and pour spouts</span> for commonly used sauces are great once you are comfortable enough to start eyeballing and improvising stir-fries. I keep light and dark soy sauce and sesame oil in their own squeeze bottles, and I top my Shaoxing wine and sake bottles with metal pour spouts for easy access during a cook.</p>

<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Most of the recipes in this book will work reasonably well in a larger skillet or, better yet, a large slope-sided saucier pan (a saucepan with gently curved corners), so if that’s all you’ve got, by all means use them.

<p class="h" id="fm8">Knives</p>
<p class="noindent_para">A good knife is a tool you’ll use virtually every time you cook. Good doesn’t have to mean expensive, though! Knives come in a dizzying array of sizes, shapes, and styles. Although many chefs (including me) collect or fetishize knives and pay careful attention to metal types, Rockwell hardness ratings, production methods, and other features, the reality is, once you get past a certain base level of quality, the best knife is the one that you feel comfortable using every day. My advice is to go to a decent knife or kitchen goods store and try a few out to see how they feel.</p>
<p class="indent_para">As a bare minimum, look for knives that are forged rather than stamped. Stamped steel will have a uniform thickness from spine to cutting edge, while forged knives are more carefully shaped for better performance. Forged knives also tend to be better balanced and have harder blades that retain their edge longer.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Your preference in knife is likely going to fall into one of four camps.</p>
<p class="h1" id="fm9"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10" title="10" class="calibre1"></span>WESTERN-STYLE CHEF’S KNIFE</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts">A traditional Western-style chef’s knife is an all-purpose knife that has a curved blade designed to allow you to hold your free hand on the top edge of the knife and rock the knife back and forth as you cut. It typically has a relatively thick spine compared to its blade length. These are heavy knives that are great for splitting hard vegetables like squashes or for hacking apart chicken carcasses.</p>

Thinner and lighter than a bulky Western-style cleaver designed to hack through bones, Chinese cleavers have a rectangular shape with a very gently curved cutting edge and a height that can extend to several inches, giving you plenty of knuckle clearance. They take a lot of getting used to if you’ve never used one. As with a santoku, they’re used with a chopping or slicing motion, as opposed to rocking. Their height and wide surface offer a few advantages. They are excellent for smashing ingredients like garlic or ginger before chopping and for transferring prepared ingredients from one place to another.</p>

<p class="sbox-h">Got an Electric or Induction Burner? You Can Still Stir-Fry!</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">For the longest time I didn’t think stir-frying was possible on an electric burner, but it is, and in some cases it can even be easier than working with a gas range. You just need to make a few adjustments.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">The key difference between electric and gas ranges is that gas ranges have flames that shoot up, heating the wok even if it is not in direct contact with the burner. This means that even while you are shaking and tossing your food, the wok is getting essentially the same amount of heat input as if it were sitting still. An electric or induction range requires direct contact for heating. This means that the wok needs to sit relatively still and flat against the burner for it to have any effect.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">Practically, this means for electric or induction cooktops you’ll want to cook in even smaller batches—as little as, say, a quarter pound of meat at a time. This is not a problem. It just means your stir-fry will take a little bit longer. Get the wok smoking hot, cook the batch of meat, transfer it to a bowl, wipe out the wok, and repeat until all your meat is seared and in the bowl. Next, do the same for all your vegetables. Finally, heat up the wok again, stir-fry your aromatics, add the meat and vegetables back to the pan along with your sauce, toss to coat and to reduce a bit, and you’re good to go.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">The other simple solution is to purchase an inexpensive portable gas range. You can find many models that run off butane canisters online or at any Asian supermarket. I’m partial to the 15,000-BTU/hr Iwatani ZA-3HP burner (available online) for its high output and sturdy design. I’m not going to come out and tell you that it’s perfectly safe to use them indoors on your kitchen counter, but I’m also not going to come into your home and stop you if you decide to do it. Just make sure you have good clearance around the flame and canister and keep your fire extinguisher handy (a good idea no matter what kind of stir-frying you’re doing).</p>
</div>
<p class="h" id="fm13">A Rice Cooker or Multicooker</p>
<p class="noindent_para">There’s a reason you’ll find big rice cookers in nearly every Japanese or Chinese restaurant and countertop models in Asian kitchens. They’re inexpensive and really good at cooking rice. Sure, it’s relatively easy to cook rice on the stovetop, but the rice cooker does it perfectly, consistently, and inexpensively at the touch of a button. If you eat rice a few times a week, a rice cooker (or, better yet, an electric countertop multicooker like an Instant Pot) is a worthwhile investment. (See “The Best Way to Cook Rice or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Rice Cooker,” <a href="part0108.html#page_226" class="calibre5">here</a>.)</p>
<p class="h1-b" id="fm14">Stocking a Wok-Friendly Pantry</p>
<p class="noindent_para">Many Asian recipes and techniques rely on a large number of seasoning sauces, pastes, pickles, and spices, to add complexity and depth to even the fastest of recipes. There’s no way around it: if you’re new to Asian cooking, you’re gonna have to stock up your pantry. This section covers the ingredients I use most.</p>
<p class="indent_para">The first time you decide to fire up the wok you may have some sticker shock from the number of bottles and sauces you need for even a very basic stir-fry. The good news is that individually most of these ingredients are cheap, and nearly all of them last for a <i class="calibre9">long</i> time. With proper storage most will last years without a big loss in quality. Hit an Asian market (or an online source) once to load up and you’ll be good to go for quite a while. If you just want to dip your feet in, your best bet is to browse the chapters, find some recipes that speak to you, and start from there.</p>
<p class="indent_para">In this section I’ve labeled all of the pantry ingredients as <i class="calibre9">beginner</i> (i.e., you’ll use them all the time), <i class="calibre9">intermediate</i> (nice to have for certain dishes), or <i class="calibre9">advanced</i> (used in only very specific cases).</p>
<p class="h1" id="fm15">SOY SAUCES</p>
<p class="noindent_para">Soy sauce is the staple seasoning of most East Asian countries, and it has been for several thousand years. It’s made by inoculating a cooked mixture of soybeans and wheat with <i class="calibre9">koji</i> (the Japanese name for the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12" title="12"></span>numerous molds of the genus <i class="calibre9">Aspergillus</i>), allowing it to incubate, then fermenting it further in a wet brine. The koji breaks down starches into simple sugars and proteins into amino acids, while lactic fermentation in the salt brine further transforms those sugars into lactic acid. The resulting dark brown sludge is pressed to remove solids, and a thin, salty, deeply flavorful dark sauce is the result. High-quality sauces are typically aged after brewing, while more inexpensive sauces may be bottled immediately for sale. The cheapest products sold as soy sauce at the supermarket, such as La Choy brand, are made with hydrolyzed soy protein, corn syrup, and artificial colors. Their flavor only loosely resembles the real deal. I avoid them.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Check the ingredients list, and if it contains any of those, leave it on the shelf. If your bottle says “naturally brewed,” you’re in good shape.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Japanese soy sauce is made with a mixture of soy and grain, which gives it a thinner texture and sweeter flavor than Chinese sauces. Japanese soy sauce <i class="calibre9">(shoyu)</i> comes in two main varieties—<i class="calibre9">koikuchi</i> (dark) and <i class="calibre9">usukuchi</i> (light). Chinese soy sauces also come in dark and light varieties, but light Chinese soy sauce is more similar in flavor and color to koikuchi sauce than usukuchi (more detail below). For everyday use, I keep a jug of Kikkoman in my fridge, refilling a smaller squeeze bottle as needed, as well as a bottle of Pearl River brand Chinese dark soy sauce.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Once opened, soy sauce can be stored in a cool, dark cabinet for several months or in the fridge for a year or more. It will eventually start to develop unpleasant fishy aromas. Of the varieties of soy sauce listed below, all have some uses, but one bottle of koikuchi shoyu and one bottle of Chinese dark soy sauce will keep you well equipped for nearly any situation.</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="sans"><b class="calibre2">Usukuchi shoyu (Japan)</b></span> is useful for when you want to season vegetables or fish without giving them a distinct dark color, but I use it at home only for a few specific uses, such as over cold tofu or in tamago-kake gohan (<a href="part0111.html#page_230" class="calibre5">here</a>). It tends to be quite salty and, due to the addition of mirin (a sweet rice wine, see <a href="part0007.html#page_20" class="calibre5">here</a>), acidic.</p>

<p class="h3a"><b class="calibre2">Oyster Sauce</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">A thick, slightly sweet sauce made with oyster extract. It has a rich, savory complexity. If you’ve seen Lee Kum Kee brand products on the supermarket shelf, this is what put them on the map. It was invented in 1888 by the founder of the company, Lee Kum Sheung, apocryphally when he accidentally left a pot of oysters simmering over a burner until it reduced to a rich gravy. It’s used widely in Chinese and Thai cuisine, as well as in Vietnam and Malaysia. These days Lee Kum Kee has two grades. The red bottle with a panda on it is made with oyster extract and other flavorings, while the blue bottle with the picture of two boys on a fishing boat labeled “Premium Oyster Sauce” is made the traditional way, with more oyster flavor.</p>
<p class="indent_para">There are many other brands of oyster sauce. So long as oyster extract is listed among the first ingredients, any brand should do fine for the recipes in this book.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Because oysters are so rich in glutamates and inosinates, the family of compounds responsible for umami flavor, it’s used to bring out the savoriness of a wide range of dishes, from stir-fried fish (<a href="part0061.html#page_137" class="calibre5">here</a>) to steamed or stir-fried green vegetables (<a href="part0096.html#page_205" class="calibre5">here</a>), or in Chinese American cashew chicken (<a href="part0283.html#page_492" class="calibre5">here</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent_para"><i class="calibre9">Doubanjiang</i>, or fermented broad bean chile sauce, is an essential sauce in Sichuan cuisine. It’s a very salty sauce made with fermented broad beans, soybeans, rice, and chiles (some varieties do not include chiles, but I’ve never seen a chile-free version sold in the United States). It’s the backbone of dishes like mapo tofu (<a href="part0347.html#page_598" class="calibre5">here</a>) and <i class="calibre9">shui zhu niu rou</i> (Water-Boiled Beef, <a href="part0349.html#page_601" class="calibre5">here</a>). It also makes for a quick and easy addition to plain noodles (try stirring a bit into your instant ramen), rice, or tofu. Compared to other jarred sauces, it’s extremely salty and powerfully flavored. A little bit goes a long way.</p>
<p class="indent_para">There is a huge difference in quality between the best versions of this sauce, which are made in Pixian, and mass-market ones such as Lee Kum Kee’s version. The former is dark red and oily, with whole fermented broad beans and a deep roasty chile flavor, while the latter tend to be more wet and paste-like and will not fry or stain your stir-fry oil red properly. This is the only essential pantry ingredient that you will most likely have to order online. But it’s inexpensive and lasts forever in the fridge.</p>
<p class="indent_para">You’ll probably come across products with the label “China Time-Honored Brand” on them, which is similar to European traditional product denotations, indicating that it is produced using a stringent set of traditional standards. According to Chris Liang of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14" title="14"></span>Mala Foods, in the case of doubanjiang, that includes the types of chiles (<i class="calibre9">er jing tiao</i>, harvested from July to the fifteenth day of lunar autumn), the types of beans (broad beans fermented for at least six months and over a summer), and the period of secondary fermentation (at least three months).</p>

It’s made by fermenting anchovies with salt, then straining the resultant liquid. In its raw, undiluted form it can smell . . . powerful. But incorporated into dishes, it brings out a level of flavor you never knew existed. It’s loaded with umami-rich compounds—even more than soy sauce—which adds savory depth to all kinds of food ranging from condiments to salad dressings, marinades, soups, stews, and stir-fries.</p>
<p class="indent_para">And it’s not just useful for Southeast Asian cuisine! I regularly add a bit of fish sauce to any meaty Western-style stew, like beef stew, chili, or even ragù Bolognese (just don’t tell your Italian grandmother), where its fishy aroma blends completely into the background. Chili with fish sauce doesn’t taste like fish; it just tastes like extra-tasty chili.</p>

Tamarind paste is easy to make at home by placing tamarind fruit pulp in a bowl with a roughly equal volume of warm water and working it with your fingers until it forms a thick paste.

<p class="h1" id="fm17">VINEGARS</p>
<p class="noindent_para">Acid! Where would we be without acid! Nine out of ten chemists and chefs agree: acid is essential. Like salt, sugar, umami, bitterness, and spiciness, acid is sensed directly in your mouth and on your tongue. But it’s also unique: most acidic foods give off vapors that tickle our noses, perking them up and helping boost our reception of other aromas. Ever notice how that vinegary whiff of buffalo sauce or the swirl of vinegar in your hot and sour soup immediately gets your saliva flowing? Even thinking about a bag of salt and vinegar potato chips will do it (your mouth is watering right now, isn’t it?). Acid helps to balance out richness, making dishes taste lighter and more palatable. And of course most culinary acids, whether made from fruits, wine, or grains, also bring a host of flavors with them. Finishing vinegars made with infusions or by aging in wooden barrels can add more layers of complexity.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Next to salt, acid is the most important element when seasoning food. But seasoning with acid works in a fundamentally different way. The right amount of salt to add to a dish generally fits within a pretty narrow window. Most people find around 1 to 1.5 percent by weight to be the most palatable range (in restaurants, especially those that want to sell you more beverages, you’re more likely getting food pushing into the 2 percent salt range). Acidity, on the other hand, can vary wildly. Some foods taste great with a ton of acid—the vinegar in Hot and Sour Soup (<a href="part0320.html#page_546" class="calibre5">here</a>) or that Chinese American staple, General Tso’s Chicken (<a href="part0280.html#page_485" class="calibre5">here</a>). Some dishes just need a splash—traditional Kung Pao Chicken (<a href="part0015.html#page_61" class="calibre5">here</a>) or the corner of a dumpling (<a href="part0226.html#page_405" class="calibre5">here</a>) dipped in black vinegar. Some need no additional acid at all: fried rice (<a href="part0143.html#page_268" class="calibre5">here</a>) and Beef Chow Fun (<a href="part0206.html#page_368" class="calibre5">here</a>) contain no extra acid other than what comes with the other ingredients.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Acids play an important role in Asian foods in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17" title="17"></span>particular, where all sorts of grains, fruits, and vegetables are fermented into vinegar or other condiments. Properly closed bottles of vinegar can be stored in a cool, dark pantry nearly indefinitely.</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Distilled White Vinegar</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Distilled white vinegar is typically made from ethanol and is designed to be neutral in flavor.

I typically use Marukan, an inexpensive Japanese brand with decent flavor. Several Chinese brands are also widely available in the states.</p>
<p class="indent_para">One thing: be careful what you pick up. “Seasoned rice vinegar” is an entirely different product, which has had sugar, salt, and seasonings added to it. It’s intended to be used as is for seasoning rice for sushi, but it’s not really useful in other cooking applications.</p>

<p class="sbox-h">The pH Scale</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Acidity is measured on the pH scale, which typically ranges from 1 (most acidic) to 14 (most alkaline).<sup class="calibre17"><a id="footnote-056-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0007.html#footnote-056" class="calibre6">*</a></sup> A pH of 7 is considered neutral. pH is measured on a logarithmic rather than linear scale. That is, a liquid with a pH of 4 will be 10 times more acidic than a liquid with a pH of 5. When experimenting in the kitchen, check the pH of your added liquids, especially if you plan to use them in a marinade. If it’s anywhere below about 4 to 4.5, it’s a good idea to dilute it well or to not let your meat marinate for more than half an hour or so.</p>

<p class="h1" id="fm18">FATS AND OILS</p>
<p class="noindent_para">As with most foods, heat, light, and air are the enemies of oil and can cause it to turn rancid. A general rule of thumb is that the more flavorful the oil, the more easily it will go bad and the more precaution you should take while storing it. To cut down on costs and improve shelf life, I buy most of my oils in large tins or tinted plastic bottles and store them in a cool, dark cabinet. For use, I use a funnel to fill (and refill) a set of dark tinted glass bottles of varying sizes fitted with pour spouts. The oils I use most go in emptied and cleaned green wine bottles, while the oils I use less frequently go in the smaller bottles I bought online.</p>
<p class="indent_para">After that I do something shocking: I store the bottles I use most on the countertop next to my stove. I know I shouldn’t. I’m pretty sure I’ve even told people not to. But hear me out. While it’s true that the heat from the stove can prematurely cause oil stored nearby to turn rancid, it still takes weeks for this to happen, which is typically more than enough time for me to finish and replenish a stock. In the five years I’ve been doing this regularly, I’ve only once had to throw out some canola oil that had become rancid. It’s a small price to pay for years of convenience. Just don’t put them straight <i class="calibre9">on</i> the burner or in the path of rising heat and vapors, OK?</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Stir-Fry/Deep-Fry Oil</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Stir-fries require oil that can be heated to a high temperature without breaking down too much. Canola, grapeseed, rice bran, and safflower are widely available and work great for stir-fries. Deep frying works better with an oil with a relatively high saturated fat content (which improves crisping). I use peanut or soybean oil, though sometimes I’ll use more inexpensive canola oil for deep frying. See “The Best Oil for Stir-Frying,” <a href="part0010.html#page_45" class="calibre5">here</a>, for more details on exactly why.</p>

<p class="noindent_para"><i class="calibre9">Caiziyou</i> is an oil expressed from cultivars of the same plant (rapeseed) used to produce canola oil. Unlike canola oil, which has a neutral flavor, caiziyou has a rich, nutty, toasted aroma that reminds me of roasted barley with a hint of mustard. It’s the cooking oil of choice in Sichuan, and, if you’ve ever thought that your chile oil or mapo tofu is lacking a certain flavor you get only at your favorite Sichuanese restaurant, caiziyou is most likely the answer. Unfortunately, it’s also very difficult to find in the United States. I’ve discovered it at one Chinese mega-mart in Seattle (Asian Family Market), but nowhere else, including in New York <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_19" title="19"></span>and San Francisco. You can order it online via Mala Market, though it can be a little pricey.</p>
<p class="indent_para">The other problem is it can be tough to identify, as it’s typically simply labeled “canola oil” or “rapeseed oil.” Visually, caiziyou will have a much darker brownish yellow color than standard canola oil, which is how I identify it at the market.</p>
<p class="indent_para">If you cannot find caiziyou, peanut oil will work in its place, but it will not have quite the same flavor properties.</p>

<p class="indent_para">Remember when people were putting Huy Fong sriracha on everything? I sure remember.

<p class="indent_para">At the table I use it in noodle dishes and soups, on dumplings and other dim sum, and on fried rice and other stir-fries. It’s even great on vanilla ice cream (really).</p>
<p class="indent_para">The one big drawback of some of the prebottled stuff is shelf life. On more than one occasion I’ve opened brand-new bottles of Lao Gan Ma to reveal fishy-smelling rancid oil inside. After opening, it should be stored sealed in the refrigerator between uses.</p>

<p class="noindent_para">As in many European cuisines, various types of wine and other alcoholic fermented products are widely used in marinades, sauces, braises, and soups. When added to dishes during cooking, booze can add an extra layer <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20" title="20"></span>of flavor and a bit of acidity that enhances the existing flavors in a dish. Alcohol is also useful for drawing out flavors from fat-soluble compounds that wouldn’t otherwise be drawn out by water and water-based liquids like stock.

<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Shaoxing Wine</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Shaoxing wine is an amber-colored type of <i class="calibre9">huangjiu—</i>fermented rice wine—that comes from the city of Shaoxing in eastern China. With a light amber color and a sweet, mildly oxidized aroma, it’s been mentioned in recorded history for over two thousand years and is nearly ubiquitous in meat-based Chinese dishes. I haven’t counted, but I’d take even odds that it’s in at least 75 percent of the recipes in this book. It’s typically used in small quantities for marinating meat or for adding its fragrant aroma to sauces, but some dishes call for lots of it. Red braised dishes like Taiwanese Braised Short Rib Noodle Soup (<a href="part0354.html#page_608" class="calibre5">here</a>) use cups of it. It’s readily available in any Asian market, but if you can’t find it, a dry sherry, with its oxidized aroma, is what most closely resembles it.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I avoid bottles labeled “cooking wine,” as those typically have about 1.5 percent salt added to them, which makes it difficult to manage seasoning in finished dishes, especially if you’re going to be reducing the wine (as you often do) and combining it with salty ingredients like soy sauce (as you often do). If it’s unavoidable (as it often is), just be aware during final seasoning.</p>

<p class="sbox-h">Alcohol, Fat, and Water</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">If you’ve ever made a salad dressing, seen the sheen of motor oil floating on a puddle, or are familiar with very common metaphors, you know that oil and water don’t mix. But what about alcohol? And what does the ability of various liquids to mix have to do with flavor?</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">To understand this, you first need to understand a few basic principles. Miscibility is the ability of two liquids to mix together and form an even solution. Alcohol and water, for instance, are miscible. Oil and water are not. Shake up a jar of oil and water, let it sit, and eventually the oil and water will separate, forming distinct layers.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">But what about alcohol? If alcohol and water weren’t miscible, every bottle of 80-proof booze would end up with all the alcohol at the top and all the water at the bottom. But alcohol and fat can <i class="calibre9">also</i> be miscible, depending on the concentration of alcohol and the temperature of the solution. In general, the higher the alcohol content, the more easily oil will mix with it and the longer it will take for that oil to separate.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">This all has to do with the polarity of a molecule, that is, the relative charge at either end of it. Molecules that are strongly polar tend to mix well with other molecules that are strongly polar, while those that are neutral mix well with other neutral molecules. Water molecules are highly polar, while oil is nonpolar. Ethanol is an amphipathic molecule, which means that it has a section that’s polar and a section that’s nonpolar. This allows it to mix to some degree with both water and fat.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">If you’re water, and that kid in college you never saw eye to eye with is fat (no, not that kind of fat), then alcohol is the stuff that might bridge the gap between you. And, just like in college, the exact degree to which fat will mix into a water/alcohol mixture is related to the alcohol content. The more alcohol, the better things mix.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">So what does all this mean for cooking? It’s true that the vast majority of alcohol will evaporate during the cooking process. There is always going to be at least a small amount left in the mix (assuming you don’t cook it until all the water is also driven off), but this tiny amount is not really enough to help fat mix in. However, because ethanol (the type of alcohol in your wine or whiskey<sup class="calibre17"><a id="footnote-055-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0007.html#footnote-055" class="calibre6">*</a></sup>) is less polar than water, some aromatic compounds that are fat-soluble can also be dissolved in alcohol. Adding alcohol to a marinade or to the liquid in a pot as a dish simmers can help draw out more of these fat-soluble compounds, making them more readily available for your nose and tongue to smell and taste.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">All this stuff is only mildly applicable to day-to-day cooking, but it sure is fun to know. And if I learned anything from G.I. Joe, it’s that most problems end with a fight, and that knowing is half the battle.</p>
<p class="line1"/>
<p class="fn-tb1"><a id="footnote-055" href="part0007.html#footnote-055-backlink" class="calibre5">*</a><span class="bull"></span>But maybe not in your moonshine. Poorly made moonshine will contain some methanol, the stuff that can make you go blind. I once spent an evening drinking moonshine with some locals in northern Bali, which they gave to me on the condition that I play “Hotel California” on their guitar. Apparently that’s the first song they associate with Americans. I did, and we drank. It was only the next day that I read about the British tourist who had gone blind doing the exact same thing (the booze, not the Eagles) a few months earlier. I can still see, and I hope that those guys still remember the lyrics, because nobody in the United States <i class="calibre9">ever</i> remembers all the lyrics. Try it right now.

<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Dry Aromatics</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Although there are plenty of dishes you can make without any dried spices or other dry pantry goods, they do make their way into many recipes, particularly noodles, soups, curries, and northern Chinese dishes. I buy my dried spices in bulk either online or from local spice shops, where you can get better deals (and fresher spices) than the little bottles you find at the supermarket. With few exceptions, I buy all my spices whole rather than ground. Whole spices retain their flavor much longer. Toasting spices whole also develops more complex <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_23" title="23"></span>and varied flavor than trying to toast ground spices, which, due to their high surface-area-to-volume ratio, can quickly lose their aroma. Whole spices also have a much longer shelf life than ground spices. Properly stored in sealed containers in a cool, dark pantry, most spices will retain their flavor for a year or more.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Not sure if your spices are too old? Just use your nose. If they don’t smell like anything in the bottle, they aren’t going to add anything to your food.</p>

<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Dry spices play an important role in a wide variety of Asian cuisines, particularly those of northern Thailand and Laos, and in northern Chinese dishes, many of which were heavily influenced by Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines through their position at the end of the Silk Road trade route.

</div>
<p class="box_parain">Some other dried goods can be a little harder to source. Here are some of the more esoteric dried spices and seeds I’ll frequently call for in this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="calibre11"></div><p class="sidebar_h"><span class="bg">Sidebar</span></p>
<div class="box-s">
<p class="sbox-h">Do I Really Need to Toast My Spices?</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Short answer: no. Even without toasting, so long as your spices are fresh, have been stored properly, and are ground just before use, they’re going to pack plenty of flavor. On the other hand, if you want to really maximize complexity and aroma, toasting spices whole before grinding will do that for you. To toast spices, place them in a dry skillet over moderate heat and cook them, stirring and shaking the pan frequently, until you can start to smell them. This should take a minute or two. Once they’re aromatic, keep going for 30 seconds or so, then transfer them from the skillet to your mortar and pestle and grind away.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">In some dishes, like Stir-Fried New Potatoes with Hot and Numbing Spices (<a href="part0086.html#page_184" class="calibre5">here</a>), ground spices are added directly to the dish just before finishing. In others, like Kung Pao Chicken (<a href="part0015.html#page_61" class="calibre5">here</a>), spices and aromatics are bloomed in hot oil before the remaining stir-fry ingredients are added. In still others, such as Mapo Tofu (<a href="part0347.html#page_598" class="calibre5">here</a>) or Chongqing-Style Dry-Fried Chicken (<a href="part0247.html#page_441" class="calibre5">here</a>), you’ll toast whole spices in oil, strain and discard them after they’ve given their flavor to the oil, then reinforce that flavor with more ground spices added during the final stages of cooking.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Sichuan Peppercorns</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">For many years, Sichuan peppercorns were banned for import to the United States due to the fear of citrus canker, a bacterial infestation that can harm the foliage of many trees and crops. Although officially banned since 1968, it was only loosely enforced in its later years and completely lifted in 2005. I remember the first time I tasted a dish made with them. It was mid-1999 at New Taste of Sichuan, and the dish was mapo tofu. A dish I grew up loving but didn’t truly understand until I tasted the Sichuan-peppercorn-laced version. It was revelatory. As I ate the tofu, my mouth was hit with an initial wave of heat, something I expected from the fiery red stew. As I ate more, my lips and tongue slowly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_24" title="24"></span>started tingling, with a unique numbing sensation that tamed some of the spiciness. The alternating feelings of intense heat and total numbness was invigorating and exciting, and I’ve been addicted ever since.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Sichuan peppercorns are the seeds of the prickly ash tree and have a warm, citrusy aroma. They are not spicy at all but produce the unique numbing, tingling effect on your mouth known as <i class="calibre9">ma</i> in Chinese. They are most commonly combined with hot chiles to produce a flavor combination called <i class="calibre9">málà</i> (“numbing hot”) associated with Sichuan cuisine (see “Málà: Sichuan’s Most Famous Flavor Export,” <a href="part0169.html#page_313a" class="calibre5">here</a>, for more details on that). Sichuan peppercorns come in both red and green varieties, with the former being milder and typically used for stir-fries or noodles and the latter being stronger in flavor and used more for soups and braises. The best place to get Sichuan peppercorns I’ve found is online through sources like the Mala Market (though I’ve had good luck with pretty much any brand that comes in sealed pouches).</p>
<p class="indent_para">If you’re going to stock only one type of Sichuan peppercorn, make it red. Bags of Sichuan peppercorns can vary in quality. The useful part of the peppercorn is the outer husk (the red or green bit). Bags with lots of shiny black seeds or twiggy stems are harder to use—you’ll have to carefully pick out those seeds and stems before grinding or blooming; the seeds have an unpleasantly crunchy, almost plastic-like texture.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Japanese cuisine uses a similar prickly ash berry, but Japanese sansho, a common condiment for grilled eel or noodle soups, is far less numbing than its Chinese counterpart.</p>
<div class="calibre11"></div><p class="sidebar_h"><span class="bg">Sidebar</span></p>
<div class="box-s">
<p class="sbox-h">Sichuan Science: What Makes Sichuan Peppercorns Tingle?</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Unlike other types of pepper, Sichuan peppercorns have no real heat to speak of. Rather, they produce a numbing sensation known as <i class="calibre9">paresthesia</i>. How does this work? Well, Sichuan peppercorns are high in a chemical called <i class="calibre9">hydroxy-alpha-sanshool</i>, which seems to stimulate the Meissner receptors in our lips, mouths, and tongues. Meissner receptors are not taste buds. They are actually nerve endings found all over the body that are responsible for perceiving light touches. A study at the University of London had subjects tasting Sichuan peppercorns, then holding a vibrating rod against their lips, adjusting the frequency of vibrations until it felt the same as Sichuan peppercorns. They found that subjects consistently set the vibrations at around 50 Hertz (50 cycles per second).</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">In other words, tasting a Sichuan peppercorn has the same effect as rapidly vibrating your lips and tongue at a frequency roughly the same as an A-flat three octaves below middle C.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">So why does that produce a numbing sensation? For the same reason that the sting of a hard slap can reduce the itchiness of a mosquito bite: when powerfully stimulated, or stimulated for a long period of time, our nerves tend to ignore weaker stimulations.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Star Anise</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Star anise is a spice originating from China shaped like an eight-pointed star. It has a licorice-like aroma similar to regular anise but is only distantly related. It’s delicious ground and blended with other warm spices like cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg in Western desserts like apple or pumpkin pie. It’s one of the essential spices in Chinese five-spice powder, and also flavors red-braised dishes in which hunks of meat are simmered in a spiced mixture of rice wine, sugar, and soy sauce. Outside of the wok, you’ll see it used to season fatty Cantonese-style roasted meats like duck or char siu (the red-tinged roasted pork shoulder you’ll find in your steamed buns or sometimes added to soups, vegetables, and other dishes.)</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Whole Dried Chiles</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">There are far too many varieties of dried chiles used throughout Asia to ever hope to remember, and you can easily get away with not being too picky if you don’t want to be. As a general rule of thumb, when shopping for dried chiles, the smaller they are, the hotter they’ll be. If you want to get more in-depth on chiles, see <a href="part0169.html#page_313" class="calibre5">here</a> for a guide to Sichuan chiles, where to get them, and when to use them.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Whole dried chiles should have a pliant texture. If they crack or split when you bend or poke them, they’re past their prime and won’t offer your food much more than heat and dusty flavor. The best way to keep dried chiles fresh is to keep them in an airtight freezer bag in the freezer. Stored that way, they’ll last for years. Alternatively, store them in tightly sealed glass mason jars in a dark, cool pantry for up to around a year.</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Ground Thai Chiles</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Ground chiles are an essential ingredient in many Thai dishes. They are powerfully hot and have a flavor that balances bright fruitiness with an almost smoky aroma. They’re commonly served as a table condiment for diners to add heat to suit their own taste; in my own house, we keep a small bowl of Thai chile flakes on the dining room table (next to the flaky sea salt and soy sauce) at all times. They’re great on pizza, pasta, and soups, too.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Some recipes claim that red pepper flakes are a suitable substitute. They are not. Thai chiles are far fruitier and more fragrant. Ground Thai chiles also tend to be very unevenly ground. This is a good thing. You end up with the powdery bits distributed all around the food, with the larger pieces offering little bursts of heat as you eat. Frankly, I can’t think of any decent substitute for Thai ground chile. Luckily, it’s readily available online, inexpensive, and lasts a long time when stored in an airtight bag in a dark pantry. Raitip-brand chiles are my go-to.</p>
<p class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_25" title="25"></span><b class="calibre2">Palm Sugar</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">If total authenticity is your goal, you’ll need a half dozen different varieties of sugar to make all the dishes in this book. At home I keep only four types: granulated white sugar, brown sugar, Colombian panela (which my Colombian wife would be lost without), and palm sugar. The latter is a staple of Thai, Indonesian, and Malaysian cooking and comes either as a thick, granular paste in tubs or as 1- to 2-inch hemisphere-shaped nuggets in jars. I prefer the hard nuggets, as the paste tends to get firmer and firmer over time, making it hard to scoop out (a quick trip to the microwave helps if paste is all you can find).</p>
<p class="indent_para">Palm sugar is an unrefined raw sugar made by boiling down the sap of various species of palm. Most often it is cut with some amount of cane sugar to reduce production cost. Its flavor is distinctly nutty, with a caramelized aroma similar to dulce de leche or condensed milk. It’s the sweet in the sweet-sour-hot flavor combo so popular in Thai cuisine and an essential ingredient in sweet chile sauce (the good stuff, not the stuff you get with your McNuggets or egg rolls) and numerous northern Thai salads, as well as a counterpoint to the heat of Thai curries.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Incidentally, the mortar and pestle is the best way to reduce those disks of palm sugar to a usable soft, moist crumble.</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Sesame Seeds</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Raw sesame seeds are pale white and bland. Toasted sesame seeds, on the other hand, have a complex peanutty aroma tinged with vanilla that pairs well with a host of other flavors, either whole, lightly crushed in a mortar and pestle or in paste form (which I buy prepasted). I’m a fan of convenience when it doesn’t sacrifice quality (who isn’t?), so I prefer to buy pretoasted sesame seeds rather than toasting raw seeds myself. (Especially because I’ve easily forgotten about and burnt more sesame seeds than I’ve successfully toasted.)</p>
<p class="indent_para">Black sesame seeds have a milder flavor than their white counterpart but make for a gorgeous garnish on finished dishes. I typically keep both black and toasted white sesame seeds on hand. If you can only find raw sesame seeds, you can toast them by stirring them constantly over medium-low heat in a dry wok until they are golden in color. Immediately transfer them to a rimmed baking sheet and spread them out to cool completely before storing in a sealed container in the pantry.</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Lily Buds</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Lily buds, also sold as “daylilies,” “tiger lilies,” or “golden needles,” are the young, unopened blossoms of the daylily. They’re about the thickness and length of a vanilla bean with a golden yellow color. When rehydrated and cooked, they have a mild flavor and pleasantly musky floral aroma (they are, after all, flowers) with a slightly crunchy texture. They’re widely available at any Chinese grocer, sold dried in plastic pouches. Look for them near the dried mushrooms and plants. Look for lily buds that are pale yellow in texture and still quite pliable. Pass on dry, cracked, or dark buds. Stored in a sealed pouch in a dark pantry, the flowers should last several years.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Paired with wood ear mushrooms, lily buds are an essential part of both moo shu dishes (<a href="part0043.html#page_104" class="calibre5">here</a>) and Hot and Sour Soup (<a href="part0320.html#page_546" class="calibre5">here</a>).</p>
<p class="h2"><a id="page_25a" class="calibre5"></a><b class="calibre2">Wood Ear Mushrooms</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Also known as “Jew’s ear” (a corruption of <i class="calibre9">Judas’ ear</i>), wood ear mushrooms are typically sold dried and need to be rehydrated before use. They have very little flavor or aroma but have a wonderful texture that’s simultaneously jellyish and crunchy. They’re an essential ingredient in Moo Shu Pork (<a href="part0043.html#page_104" class="calibre5">here</a>) and Hot and Sour Soup (<a href="part0320.html#page_546" class="calibre5">here</a>), but can also be a great addition to simple stir-fries. The dried mushrooms can be stored in the pantry virtually indefinitely. See <a href="part0044.html#page_110" class="calibre5">here</a> for instructions on how to clean wood ear mushrooms.</p>
<p class="h2"><b class="calibre2">Dried Shrimp, Flounder, and Scallops</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Dried seafood plays an important role in many coastal and island Asian cuisines. Dried shrimp are a star ingredient of Thai som tam (green papaya salad, <a href="part0363.html#page_619" class="calibre5">here</a>). Soaked and chopped, they can be added to soups, stir-fries, or rice.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Dried fish and scallops are rich sources of inosinate and guanosine, two proteins that are found in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_26" title="26"></span>abundance in seafood, particularly dried seafood, where it gets concentrated. On their own, inosinate and guanosine have no real flavor; they merely act to increase our own perception of savoriness, much like sprinkling your meat with salt will not just make it taste salty but will actually make it taste more like itself.</p>
<p class="indent_para">(There’s a reason disodium guanylate—a salt form of guanosine—is used regularly as a flavor enhancer in instant noodles and chips.)</p>
<p class="indent_para">They also enhance the effects of glutamic acid, the amino acid found in things like Parmesan cheese, mushrooms, and ham that give us the saliva-inducing sensation of umami, or savoriness. They’re what separate a great wonton soup from the thin, salty stuff you get at the strip mall (or at least the <i class="calibre9">bad</i> strip malls).</p>
<p class="indent_para">Combined with dried ham, garlic, ginger, chiles, and a handful of other glutamate-rich ingredients, they make XO sauce, an insanely savory condiment created in Hong Kong in the 1980s and so-named to capture the cachet of cognac, though it contains none. (See <a href="part0165.html#page_303" class="calibre5">here</a> for more details and a recipe.)</p>
<p class="indent_para">Dried flounder, scallops, and shrimp are available at Asian grocers or online. In some recipes they’re difficult to replace, but in brothier settings Japanese kombu (dried sea kelp) will add the umami depth (but not the stronger seafood aromas).</p>

<div class="box-s">
<p class="sbox-h">Why Are There So Many Chiles?</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Perhaps you’ve been to a Sichuanese restaurant and ordered dishes packed with fistfuls of crimson red dried chiles. I know when I was younger my thought process in these situations went something like this:</p>
<p class="sbox-indent"><i class="calibre9">Am I supposed to eat these? Will I out myself as a noob if I ask? Or will I out myself as a noob if I don’t ask and do the wrong thing? They seem kinda papery. I don’t like eating paper. Will I like eating these? Oh crap, here comes the server, and he already saw me poking at them. Better make a decision fast. Hmm. It is papery. Just look straight ahead and keep chewing. OK. That skin is finally breaking down and . . . oh man that’s hot. Should I ask for water? Will I out myself as a noob if I ask for water? Why didn’t I just order the wonton soup, egg rolls, and General Tso’s again? At least</i> those <i class="calibre9">dishes won’t out me as a noob.</i></p>
<p class="sbox-indent">Here’s the answer: don’t eat those chiles. They are not meant to be eaten. So what’s the point of stir-frying an ingredient that nobody is going to eat? The answer is aroma and visual aesthetics. Typically those chiles are toasted lightly in the oil before other ingredients are added, lending the finished dish a sweet, fragrant scent. That scent is important! Our tongues and soft palates detect a range of different flavors, but the vast majority of what makes a certain food taste of itself lies in its aroma—the molecules of stuff that jump off the food and into our noses.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">You can easily test this at home by eating various foods while pinching your nose. Without the help of olfactory sensors, apples and pears taste virtually the same. Heck, even an <i class="calibre9">onion</i> and an apple taste remarkably similar when your nose is pinched. In other words, you don’t need to eat those chiles to be able to taste them.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">The visual appearance of food is also important in our perception. The phrase “you eat with your eyes” is more than just a folksy saying. Foods that look better taste better. This is because taste is not something that is perceived by our mouths and noses alone. It’s something that is created in our brain. A whole confluence of sensory input affects it. Foods that are supposed to be crunchy don’t taste as good when they’re mushy, even if the flavor is exactly the same. Green ketchup tastes worse than red ketchup (do you remember when green and blue ketchup were a thing?). Very few people recognize that green Haribo gummi bears are actually raspberry flavored. (It’s true! Take a green gummi bear, close your eyes, and taste it.) Those piles of red chiles may not significantly affect the flavor of our food as perceived on the tongue, but they definitely affect the way our brain interprets those flavors.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_27" title="27"></span><b class="calibre2">Kombu (Giant Sea Kelp)</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">Kombu, or giant sea kelp, is an essential ingredient in the Japanese stock dashi (<a href="part0299.html#page_519" class="calibre5">here</a>), and is the natural product from which pure MSG was first derived. It’s sold in sheets typically a few inches wide and several inches long, ranging from dark moss green to pale beige or yellow. It comes in a wide range of qualities, at least if you look hard enough. (If you have good neighbors, you may even get by with a little kelp from your friends.) Most folks will have access to at most a few different quality levels and price points, representing different subspecies of kelp and different levels of retained glutamates. Unless you’re after a pristine, subtle, crystal-clear, oceany broth (which, unless you happen to be the chef at a fancy <i class="calibre9">kaiseki</i> restaurant, you probably aren’t), there’s no need to spring for the fancy stuff. Even the cheapest grade of kombu will make great dashi.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I generally recommend looking for kombu that has more of the powdery white mineral deposits dried onto its surface, as my grandmother showed me. This frequently leads me to the cheaper stuff. While subtle broths are favored by many fancy restaurants, my tastes tend to run cheap when it comes to dashi, and those powdery crystallized minerals correlate to more robust umami flavor. (I’m not sure whether my grandmother bought it for the flavor or because she was thrifty, but either way, I follow the same path.)</p>
