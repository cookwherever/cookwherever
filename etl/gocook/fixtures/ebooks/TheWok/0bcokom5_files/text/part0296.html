<p class="noindent_paraavtop"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_510" title="510"></span><span class="dropcap1">A</span>s someone who grew up fishing, for many years I thought it was all about catching fish. Whether it was snaring a fat rainbow trout on a Royal Wulff or hooking into that striper off Stellwagen Bank on a live pogie at the mouth of the Massachusetts Bay, fishing was about the <i class="calibre9">action</i>. It’s only now, when I think back on fishing trips with my father and sisters, that I realize the vast majority of my pleasant memories are from the more subtle parts of fishing. Standing in waders off the icy banks of the Gallatin River by my sister’s home in Montana. Riding out on Boston Harbor in my dad’s boat, eating bologna sandwiches<sup class="calibre10"><a id="footnote-015-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0298.html#footnote-015" class="calibre6">*</a></sup> and Cape Cod chips. The action is great, but there’s a whole lot more to fishing than that.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Likewise, it’s easy to associate woks with extreme cooking—the intense heat of a Cantonese stir-fry, the nose-tingling aroma of chiles and Sichuan peppercorns toasting, the food leaping and dancing through live flames. In this chapter I want to focus on the quieter side of wok cooking: simmering and braising. Techniques that can push tough cuts of meat or starchy root vegetables into tender, savory submission. Brothy recipes that range from the subtlest bowl of miso soup to the most intense Thai curry or kimchi stew.</p>
<p class="indent_para">This is the calmer side of wok cooking. Let’s start with the basics: making and using stock.</p>
<p class="h">Stock Basics</p>
<p class="noindent_para">Stock and broth are both made by simmering together vegetables and, usually, animal bones and connective tissue. They can be watery and thin in texture (as in the case of a vegetable stock) or thick and gelatinous (animal connective tissue will break down into gelatin, which adds body to stocks). They can be made with raw bones and vegetables, or they can be made with roasted ingredients. They may contain aromatics, such as peppercorns or bay leaves or ginger, or they can be as simple as a chicken carcass simmered in water.</p>
<p class="indent_para">There’s plenty of linguistic debate on the difference between stock and broth (and that’s before we even get into the opaque, milky-white quagmire of so-called “bone broths”). Some (including me in the past) would say that the inclusion of connective tissue and bones is what differentiates stock from broth. Others would say that stocks are basic building blocks for cooking, while broths have already been seasoned with salt and are ready to drink. In all honesty, it doesn’t matter much, and the terms can generally be used interchangeably.</p>
<p class="indent_para">What <i class="calibre9">does</i> matter is the way in which you make or buy them and how you utilize them in your cooking. Let’s take stock of the basics.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_511" title="511"></span><span class="dropcap">Q</span> What’s the difference between Western and Asian stocks and broths?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> Fundamentally, not much. Both Western and Asian stocks are made by simmering ingredients in water to draw out their flavor for use in other dishes. In both Western and Asian cuisines, making stock can be a means to extract more flavor and nutrients from ingredients that would otherwise be discarded (a chicken carcass or ham bone with the meat removed, the tough stems of herbs, vegetable trimmings, dry aromatics, etc.), a way to introduce more flavor to a dish (by using stock in place of water, for instance), or both.</p>
<p class="box_parain">In fact, to try to divide stocks into these East vs. West categories, I’m forced to make some extremely broad generalizations, so please note that if you really want to get a full understanding of the breadth of techniques used to make stock and the wide range of scenarios in which it’s used, you’ll need to dive deeper into an individual cuisine than this book allows for.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Many of the differences come down to ingredient choice. In Western cuisines, stock is typically made with animal bones and connective tissue, along with mirepoix, the classic combination of carrot, celery, and onion. Frequently other types of alliums, such as leeks or garlic, will also be included, as will herbs and aromatics like bay leaves, peppercorns, parsley, or thyme. While pork stock, venison stock, lamb stock, and others exist, by far the most common animal parts used for stock in the West are chicken carcasses, veal bones (which offer a ton of connective tissue and yield very rich, gelatinous stock), and fish bones for quick <i class="calibre9">fumets</i>.</p>
<p class="box_parain">In contrast, meat-based Asian stocks will frequently feature ingredients like fresh ginger, scallions, and garlic as their main vegetal elements, or they may use charred onions and ginger (as with some ramen or pho broths). Chicken is still a popular stock choice, but depending on the country and region pork (especially gelatin-rich pork trotters and heads), ham, mutton, and beef are used as well. Dried seafood is used extensively in broths throughout Asia. It can be subtle, as with Japanese dashi, made only with dried sea kelp and dried bonito, or it can be an intense flavor enhancer, as with the dried flounder, scallop, or shrimp added to Chinese “superior stock” when making an aromatic wonton soup base.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Aromatic choices can vary wildly throughout Asia as well. Classic Thai tom yam soup is flavored with a slew of fresh aromatics: lemongrass, galangal, makrut lime leaf, shallot, garlic, chiles, etc. The deep red broth for Taiwanese beef noodle soup features warm spices like fennel, star anise, and cinnamon. South Vietnamese pho might be seasoned with rock sugar and herbs like culantro and lemon basil, while North Vietnamese pho focuses on the cleaner, simpler flavors.</p>
<p class="box_parain">The point is, there’s variation in stock, and an awful lot of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> When should I make homemade broth, and when is it OK to use store-bought?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> I use store-bought stocks and concentrated bouillon pastes, powders, and cubes pretty extensively at home. I also make and use an awful lot of homemade stocks. The only situation where I find homemade stock—or, at the very least, well-doctored store-bought stock—to be essential is when making brothy, aromatic soups. Dishes like wonton soup (<a href="part0325.html#page_554" class="calibre5">here</a>) or Chicken and Ginger Soup (<a href="part0318.html#page_544" class="calibre5">here</a>) rely on well-seasoned stocks flavored with a specific set of aromatics, and without those specific aromatics, they just won’t taste right.</p>
<p class="box_parain">For soups that rely on many other seasonings—Hot and Sour Soup (<a href="part0320.html#page_546" class="calibre5">here</a>), or Tom Yam Kung (<a href="part0346.html#page_597" class="calibre5">here</a>), for instance—starting with a homemade stock will help, but it won’t make or break the dish. Likewise, when stock is an ingredient in the sauce for a stir-fry, or in the simmering liquid for Japanese-stye donburi—such as Gyudon (<a href="part0116.html#page_235" class="calibre5">here</a>) or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_512" title="512"></span>Oyakodon (<a href="part0114.html#page_233" class="calibre5">here</a>)—using homemade stuff will improve the flavor and texture of the final dish, but using store-bought stock or even water with a dash of bouillon in place of chicken stock, or granulated Hondashi in place of fresh dashi, will get the job done.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="ans-q"><span class="dropcap">Q</span> How long does a stock need to simmer?</p>
<p class="image-1s"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre12"/></p>
<p class="ans-a"><span class="dropcap">A</span> It all depends on what ingredients you’re adding to it. For the most part, aromas are extracted relatively quickly. That means that after the first 20 to 30 minutes those thin slices of ginger, the onion chunks, the garlic, the dry spices, the herbs have all given up about as much as they’re going to give. With meat and bones flavor takes a little bit longer to extract. The exact timing can vary depending on the specific animal you’re using and the size of the pieces, ranging from around 45 minutes for chopped chicken carcasses and wings to several hours for whole chicken carcasses and meaty chunks of beef shin or pork trotters.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Connective tissue, mainly collagen, is the fibrous or rubbery white sinews and yellowish tissues that keep meat attached to bones and bones connected with each other. Collagen is also what gives skin its elastic stretchiness. When making stock, we aren’t trying to extract collagen per se. Rather, we’re trying to convert that collagen into gelatin. In its natural state, collagen is a tightly wound protein made of three tightly interwound strands (its structure is known as a <i class="calibre9">triple helix</i>). As collagen is cooked in the presence of water, it unravels and hydrolyzes, forming gelatin, a series of proteins and peptides that range in weight and length but have the ability to form a loosely interconnected matrix that gives stock body when hot, and causes it to solidify into a jelly-like mass when cooled. Depending on the concentration of gelatin, this jelly will range from a slightly viscous liquid to a substance as firm and bouncy as a rubber ball.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Collagen transformation depends not just on the presence of heat and water, but on <i class="calibre9">time</i> as well. So while the flavor of a chicken stock may not change that much after the first hour or so of simmering, it’ll continue to gain body over the course of a few hours as gelatin is extracted. Collagen comes in many different forms, and as a general rule, the more support work collagen has to do, the more time it takes to fully extract and convert into gelatin for a stock.</p>
<p class="box_parain">Collagen in pork bones, for instances, takes longer to extract than in lighter chicken carcasses. In veal bones, it takes longer still—many veal stock recipes call for 12- or even 24-hour simmering times. Fish, which spend their life supported in the semi-weightless environment of the ocean, on the other hand, have very fast-extracting collagen. Boil a fish carcass and you won’t see much change after a mere 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="box_parain">This chart gives you a good idea of how long you can expect to simmer ingredients for flavor and collagen extraction. When designing your own broth, it’s easy enough to dump everything into the pot and strain it out when you feel like it’s finished (how I make 75 percent of my broths at home), but if you want to maximize flavor and body, start with the most long-cooking ingredients (such as bones with lots of connective tissue) and progressively add shorter-cooking ingredients (such as vegetables and aromatics), timing it so that everything finishes around the same time. (Overboiling aromatics can actually cause a broth to slowly lose aroma—if you can smell an aromatic compound in the air, it’s no longer in the pot.)</p>
<p class="box_parain">Note that younger animals in general have more connective tissue and fewer fully developed muscles, which means, for instance, that with enough time, veal bones will give up much more gelatin than beef bones.</p>
