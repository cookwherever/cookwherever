<p class="recipe_rdt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_111" title="111"></span>GROUND PORK WITH HOLY BASIL (PAD KA-PRAO) IS THE EASIEST STIR-FRY FOR BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER, OR ANY TIME IN BETWEEN</p>
<p class="noindent_para">Pad ka-prao is a ubiquitous street dish in Thailand, where cooks wielding woks will rapidly stir-fry sliced or minced meat flavored with garlic, shallots, fish sauce, and fiery Thai bird chiles, finish it off with a big handful of holy basil, and serve it with rice and perhaps a fried egg on top. Unless there’s running water nearby, you’ll probably eat it from plates wrapped in the world’s thinnest plastic bags (designed to be slipped off and discarded after use, like a plate condom), knees bent and back hunched, over a small plastic table. The only things thinner than those plastic bags are the napkins that disintegrate as you try to wipe the sweat from your brow.</p>
<p class="indent_para">In the United States, on the other hand, it’s simultaneously one of the most commonly ordered Thai dishes and the least consumed. Let me explain. Order pad ka-prao from a typical American Thai restaurant and instead of the spicy, almost medicinal flavor of jagged-edged, fuzzy-leafed holy basil (<i class="calibre9">ka-prao</i>), you’re going to taste the sweet, anise-like flavor of Thai purple basil (<i class="calibre9">bai horapa</i>), or perhaps even sweet Italian basil (the horror!). Holy basil is difficult to come by ’round these parts, you see.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Now, I could let this unfortunate state of affairs drive me to great lengths—literally—in search of the few leaves of holy basil that make their way within my shopping radius so that I might be able to recapture some of that Thai flavor. Instead, I generally choose to accept the fact that pad bai horapa is not pad ka-prao, but it’s still darned delicious in its own right. Even in Thailand, stir-fries with purple basil are commonly served, so we don’t have to lose out on the authenticity points.<sup class="calibre10"><a id="footnote-047-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0045.html#footnote-047" class="calibre6">*</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent_para">It’s really an issue only if you’re a stickler for proper nomenclature or <i class="calibre9">really</i> want that authentic holy basil flavor. (Unless you’ve been to Thailand, there’s a good chance you’ve never tasted it anyway.) As my friend and Thai food expert Leela Punyaratabandhu explains, just call your ground meat stir-fry made with purple or sweet basil pad bai horapa instead, and everyone should be happy, especially when invited for lunch. (See the sidebar “Common Culinary Basils” on <a href="part0056.html#page_130" class="calibre5">here</a> for more on basil types.)</p>
<p class="indent_para">Unlike many Chinese-stir-fries that rely on intense heat for flavor development with aromatics added toward the end to prevent burning, Thai stir-fries frequently use more moderate heat, instead building flavors by frying aromatics in oil at the start before adding the remaining ingredients. This stir-fry starts with one of the Holy Trinities of Thai stir-fries: chiles, shallots, and garlic. A big granite mortar and pestle is by far the best tool for releasing the flavor of these aromatics (see <a href="part0335.html#page_576" class="calibre5">here</a> for more on the science of mortars and pestles), though you can also chop them by hand or use a minichopper.</p>
<p class="indent_para">As for the meat, preground stuff from the supermarket is an easy option and works just fine. With store-bought meat you can have this dish on the table in about 15 minutes start to finish. But if you want to go that extra mile, I would recommend chopping meat by hand or in the food processor, as I do when I want the best hamburgers.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Purists will insist that this dish be seasoned with nothing but fish sauce and perhaps a little palm sugar, but most versions you’ll find in the United States—and even frequently in Thailand—will also be seasoned with dark soy sauce and perhaps a dash of oyster sauce. I generally prefer the fish-sauce-only version, which has a brighter, fresher flavor, but it really depends on my mood.</p>
<p class="indent_para">If you want to make this into an easy, slightly more balanced meal, you can add some green beans or long beans that have been sliced into short segments. They cook in about the same time as the meat does, so you can go ahead and add them to the wok together with the meat.</p>
<p class="indent_para">No matter which version I make, a fried egg—and I mean a <i class="calibre9">really</i> fried egg that’s crispy and lacy around the edges (see <a href="part0046.html#page_114" class="calibre5">here</a>)—has a home right on top of it.</p>
