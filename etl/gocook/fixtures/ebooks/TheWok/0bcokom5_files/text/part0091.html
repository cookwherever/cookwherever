<p class="sbox-noindent">For homemade pickled chiles, see <a href="part0029.html#page_84" class="calibre5">here</a>. If you prefer a milder version of the dish, omit the pickled chiles and use distilled white vinegar in place of the pickling liquid in the sauce. The ground pork is optional. If you omit it, the dish is entirely vegan.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent_para">This is another <i class="calibre9">yuxiang</i> (fish-fragrant) dish that, like Shredded Chicken with Pickled Chiles and Carrots (<a href="part0028.html#page_82" class="calibre5">here</a>), contains no seafood. You stir-fry eggplant until smoky and tender, then toss it with a quick sauce flavored with chiles, garlic, ginger, vinegar, and sometimes minced pork, for a flavor-packed dish that comes together in one wok with minimal effort.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Cooking the dish at home is pretty straightforward, and the effort-to-flavor ratio is off the charts. The only tricky part is handling the eggplant. It needs to be steamed, salted, or brined before being stir-fried to break down its structure a bit and allow it to cook without absorbing excess moisture. (See “Buying and Salting Eggplants for Stir-Fries,” <a href="part0091.html#page_194" class="calibre5">here</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent_para">Eggplant really benefits from a nice deep browning. Plain eggplant is bland. Mushy, watery, insipid—it’s no wonder so many people dislike it. Many versions of this dish call for deep frying the eggplant to uniformly brown it before stir-frying. I prefer to shallow-fry it in the wok, taking a rather orderly approach by arranging the eggplant in a single layer and turning the pieces individually until they are well browned on all sides. It makes for a lighter dish (not to mention you don’t have a couple cups of slightly used strained oil on your hands, as you do with the deep-fry method).</p>
<p class="indent_para">So: eggplant gets brined, eggplant gets browned, aromatics are added, sauce is stirred in, everybody inside the pan gets happy for a minute or two, then everyone outside the pan gets even happier as they down it.</p>

<p class="snoindent">There are two ways to cut a Chinese or Japanese eggplant for stir-fries. Which method you choose is up to your own personal taste; both will work equally well.</p>
<p class="noindentst"><b class="calibre2">METHOD 1 • THE ROLL CUT</b></p>
<p class="snoindenttys">Roll-cut eggplants form bite-sized wedges.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="red1">Step 1 •</span> Trim Off the Stem</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00265.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre36"/></p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Start by trimming the stem end. I like to pull back the edges of the stem that hang down over the eggplant flesh to maximize the amount of edible eggplant I get from each plant.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="red1">Step 2 •</span> Make the First Cut</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00266.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre36"/></p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Cut a bite-sized wedge off of the top, holding your knife at a 45-degree angle to the eggplant.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="red1">Step 3 •</span> Roll and Cut Again</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00267.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre36"/></p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Roll the eggplant away from you by a quarter turn and make another cut at the same angle.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="red1">Step 4 •</span> Roll and Repeat</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00268.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre36"/></p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Continue cutting, rolling the eggplant a quarter turn each time you cut until you reach the end.</p>
<p class="liner"/>
<p class="noindentst"><b class="calibre2">METHOD 2 • BATONS</b></p>
<p class="snoindenttys">Eggplant batons are small bite-sized segments. Start by trimming the stem off the eggplant in the same manner as for a roll cut.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="red1">Step 1 •</span> Split Lengthwise</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00269.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre36"/></p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Split the eggplant lengthwise.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="red1">Step 2 •</span> Split Again</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00270.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre36"/></p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Lay each eggplant half cut side down on a cutting board and split them again. For particularly large eggplants, you may want to split each half lengthwise into thirds or even quarters.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="red1">Step 3 •</span> Cut Segments</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">Cut the eggplant crosswise into 2- to 3-inch batons.</p>

<p class="sbox-h">Buying and Salting Eggplants for Stir-Fries</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">If you’re used to big ol’ globe eggplants—the kind you slice and fry for eggplant Parmesan—the wide range of Asian eggplants available at the Asian supermarket may be baffling to you. If you have access to a well-stocked Southeast Asian market, you’ll find an even wider range, from pure white egg-shaped eggplants (the variety the plant gets its name from) to tiny green eggplants no larger than a pea. But there are really only three varieties you need to know about for most recipes.</p>
<p class="sarrows"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="sanrd1">Japanese eggplants</span> are deep purple to black in color and look sort of like miniaturized versions of globe eggplants. They are dense and mildly flavored and work well in both Western and Asian recipes. The best should feel quite heavy for their size.</p>
<p class="sarrows"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="sanrd1">Chinese eggplants</span> are longer and skinnier and range from dark to pale purple. They soften and become sweet and dense in stir-fries and are great at absorbing the flavor from sauces. Look for eggplants that have pure white skin underneath their stems and are shiny and blemish-free for the best flavor.</p>
<p class="sarrows"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="sanrd1">Thai eggplants</span> are round and the size of golf balls. Green are the ones you’ll typically find in Southeast Asian supermarkets in the West, but they also come in purple and white varieties. They are commonly used in green and red curries or sliced raw and used in salads.</p>
<p class="sbox-indentt">For stir-fries I typically reach for Chinese or Japanese eggplants. Either way, simply cutting them and stir-frying them does not work. The eggplants absorb all the oil in the wok, which in turn causes the eggplant to stick and burn. Raw, untreated eggplants also take a long time to cook through, exacerbating the burning problem.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">Why is this? It’s because eggplants contain a lot of excess air distributed within a spongy cell network. Air acts as an insulator, which means that heat travels through an eggplant very slowly. This is one of the reasons you always want to buy an eggplant that feels nice and heavy for its size: denser eggplants have less air and will cook more evenly, with better flavor and texture.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">So how do you solve this problem? There are a few suggested techniques, and I tested all of them.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00271.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre4"/></p>
<p class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_195" title="195" class="calibre1"></span><img src="../images/00272.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre48"/></p>
<p class="sbox-indent">Almost all of the methods you hear about involve an attempt to break down the internal cellular structure of the eggplant either through heating or with the application of salt. In the past I’ve used the steaming method for dishes in which the eggplant is going to be braised until fall-apart tender. It’s simple: put the eggplant slices in a bamboo steamer set over a wok of simmering water and steam them for about 10 minutes until tender.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00273.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre48"/></p>
<p class="sbox-indent">Steaming works great if you’ve got a steamer. Just be aware that it comes out <i class="calibre9">extremely</i> tender when you treat it this way and can only handle a few very brief stirs in the wok without turning to a homogenous mush.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">Microwaving the eggplant until cooked through is a technique I use when I’m breading eggplant for American-style eggplant Parmesan, but it’s not ideal for stir-fries. The eggplant pieces end up a little shriveled and lack the velvety texture I’m looking for.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">That leaves salting. Typically, salting takes place on dry land. You sprinkle the eggplants with a bit of salt, then let them sit until the salt pulls out excess moisture through osmosis, causing the cell structure to collapse. But I’ve also seen recipes that call for brining eggplant: soaking them in a saltwater solution. This seems counterintuitive to me. Aren’t we trying to get rid of excess moisture? I decided to compare the two methods side by side, also testing them against eggplant soaked in unsalted water and plain, untreated eggplant as a control.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">After their brief 10-minute soak in salt water the eggplant pieces did not look all that different, but after drying them with paper towels and weighing them, I found that they actually lost a little weight during their soak. Osmosis would explain this: so long as the concentration of salt outside the eggplant is higher than the concentration of other solutes inside the eggplant’s cell, water from the cells should be forced outward in an attempt to reach equilibrium. Sixty grams of salt for each liter of water—about ¼ cup kosher salt per quart—worked well.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">I cooked all four batches of eggplant using the same method in a hot wok with oil, cooking them until lightly charred on the exterior and tender throughout. Both the salted and brined eggplants cooked faster and browned better than their water-soaked or untreated counterparts.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00274.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre48"/></p>
<p class="sbox-indent">And whaddaya know? The brined eggplant was actually the best of the bunch. It managed to brown and soften while still retaining a nice meaty bite. The salted eggplant came in a close second, but was not quite as easy to cook. Brining eggplant is also easier than salting: salting eggplant requires a big rack to lay the slices out. Brined eggplant is good to go with just a single bowl.</p>
<p class="sbox-h"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_196" title="196"></span>All about Garlic</p>
<p class="sbox-noindent">The aromatic compounds we associate with alliums like garlic and onions are collectively known as <i class="calibre9">lachrymators</i> (from the Latin root for tears), and the one responsible for garlicky aroma is called <i class="calibre9">allicin</i>. Interestingly, they don’t actually exist in raw, unblemished garlic and onions. Those compounds are created only after cells are burst open and precursor chemicals combine and react to form new, pungent molecules. The more active precursor in each cell and the more cells that get ruptured, the more of those compounds are created, so the method by which you cut or mince your garlic can have a profound impact on its flavor, as does the form in which you buy your garlic.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/00275.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre51"/></p>
<p class="sbox-indent">Let’s start with shopping.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">At the supermarket, there are really only two forms of garlic you should be considering: whole heads or prepeeled raw cloves.<sup class="calibre17"><a id="footnote-039-backlink" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0091.html#footnote-039" class="calibre6">*</a></sup></p>
<p class="sbox-indent">As for fresh garlic, because garlic flavor is created as soon as garlic cells are ruptured and increases steadily with time, any form of garlic that comes precut—such as minced garlic, garlic paste, or garlic extract—either will be lacking in fresh garlic flavor or will have a flavor that is far too pungent as the <i class="calibre9">allicin</i>-forming reactions have been allowed to progress for too long. Garlic is one of those ingredients that <i class="calibre9">must</i> be chopped right before use.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">In side-by-side tests, I’ve found that in dishes where garlic is the primary flavor or where garlic is served mostly raw, fresh cloves removed from a whole head and peeled just before use have a cleaner, more garlicky flavor than prepeeled raw cloves of garlic, though the latter do just fine the vast majority of the time.</p>
<p class="sbox-indent">Here are some common methods along with when you may want to employ them:</p>
<div class="bullet-list">
<p class="sarrow"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="sanrd1"><b class="calibre2">Crushing in a mortar and pestle</b></span> is the method I use most of the time. With a heavy granite mortar and pestle, you can get your garlic any texture ranging from lightly crushed to a fine mince, or even a smooth paste in a matter of seconds. If a recipe calls for chopped garlic, this is the way I’m going to do it. (Bonus: for recipes that call for both minced garlic and ginger, you can peel and slice your ginger, then pound it in the mortar and pestle together with the garlic.)</p>
</div>
<p class="sbox-indent">The only downside of this method is that it crushes plenty of cells, so the garlic has a tendency to get pungent unless used within 10 to 15 minutes of crushing. Just make sure you leave the garlic until just before you start cooking and it’ll be just fine.</p>
<div class="bullet-list">
<p class="sarrow"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="sanrd1"><b class="calibre2">Mincing with a knife</b></span> by smashing a clove and then rocking a chef’s knife back and forth or chopping up and down with a cleaver or santoku knife lets you mince as fine as you’d like. Because a sharp knife ruptures fewer cells than a blunt pestle, this method is best for when you intend to use the garlic raw, such as for topping Dan Dan Noodles (<a href="part0171.html#page_317" class="calibre5">here</a>) or incorporating into a smashed cucumber salad (see <a href="part0359.html#page_615" class="calibre5">here</a>). It can also be used for garlic that you are going to stir-fry if you don’t have a mortar and pestle.</p>
<p class="sarrow"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="sanrd1"><b class="calibre2">Using a garlic press or Microplane</b></span> squeezes out a ton of garlic juice, which can turn quite pungent and hot just a few moments after pressing. I would not recommend a garlic press or Microplane for any garlic intended to be eaten raw, and if you plan on using it for a stir-fry, your best option is to press or plane it immediately before you start the cooking process to minimize the time between when it’s crushed and when it’s cooked.</p>
<p class="sarrow"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="sanrd1"><b class="calibre2">Slicing with a knife</b></span> will give you mildly flavored pieces of garlic that are distinct in the final dish and can be eaten and enjoyed for their flavor and texture like other vegetables. In a dish like Pepper and Salty Shrimp (<a href="part0252.html#page_447" class="calibre5">here</a>), sweet, mild slices of garlic that you can pick up with your chopsticks and eat are almost as essential a part of the dish as the shrimp.</p>
<p class="sarrow"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre18"/><span class="bull"></span><span class="sanrd1"><b class="calibre2">Smashing whole cloves with the side of a knife or cleaver</b></span> is a good technique for exposing the interior of a garlic clove just enough to allow you to use it to infuse oil for stir-frying. This allows you to impart a sweet garlic flavor without adding excess pungency.</p>
</div>
<p class="line2"/>
<p class="fn-tb1"><a id="footnote-039" href="part0091.html#footnote-039-backlink" class="calibre5">*</a><span class="bull"></span>The other exception is granulated or powdered garlic, which, like powdered ginger, tastes nothing like its fresh form, but it has a flavor all its own and can be useful in spice blends (or for sprinkling on pizza).</p>
