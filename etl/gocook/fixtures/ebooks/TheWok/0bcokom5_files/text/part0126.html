<p class="noindent_para">Rice porridge. Gruel. Mush. Pap. These are all excellent words to use if you want to describe to someone what congee is without giving any hint of its deliciousness or its exciting possibilities. Silky, creamy, comforting, and intensely savory are how I’d describe it. There’s a reason it’s eaten all across Asia at all hours of the day, whether for breakfast in Thailand, at a dim sum house in Hong Kong, or at an all-night hawker center in Singapore after an evening of drinking.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Congee (known as <i class="calibre9">zhou</i> in mainland China, <i class="calibre9">juk</i> in Korea, <i class="calibre9">bubur</i> in Indonesia, <i class="calibre9">okayu</i> in Japan, etc.) on its own can be deliciously comforting, but it really shines when you spruce it up with mix-ins and condiments. Leftover roast chicken or turkey can be transformed into a meal by simmering it in a pot of congee with some fresh ginger, white pepper, and a sprinkle of scallions. The head of romaine that is not quite crisp and fresh enough for Caesar salad can find a new home wilted in a bowl of congee. The farmers’ market haul of corn and kale makes a hearty congee lunch. You get the idea.</p>
<p class="indent_para">In Asia, congee is frequently made with an inexpensive bag of broken rice grains, but it’s not easy to find broken rice in the States. That’s OK. Congee can just as easily be made with regular rice. At home, I most frequently make it with short-grain Japanese rice or other varieties high in amylopectin, which gives the finished congee a velvety, tongue-coating texture (think: risotto taken to the extreme), though jasmine rice also makes great, fragrant congee.</p>
<p class="indent_para">The simplest way to make congee—by simmering rice in water or stock on the stove—is also the most time-consuming. It’s largely hands-off time, but it still takes about an hour, start to finish.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Fortunately there are several ways to speed up the process. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="red3">THE PRESSURE COOKER METHOD:</span> Combine rice and water in a pressure cooker (pressure cookers don’t allow as much liquid to escape via evaporation as a saucepan on the stove, so cut water down by about 10 percent), seal the cooker, and cook at high pressure (12 to 15 psi) for 20 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally (do not attempt a quick release—the starchy water will come bubbling and shooting out of the release valve and make a huge mess), then open the cooker and bring to a vigorous simmer, stirring until the porridge is as thick as you like it.</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="red3">THE OVERNIGHT SOAKING METHOD:</span> This method was inspired by my favorite way to cook steel-cut oatmeal: toast it dry and soak it overnight to hasten cooking the next morning. It works the same way with rice: Combine water and rice in a saucepan (you can toast the rice beforehand if you like the aroma of toasty rice), cover, and let it sit overnight. The next morning, bring it to a simmer, stirring occasionally. It should be creamy and ready to eat in about half an hour.</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="red3">THE MORTAR AND PESTLE METHOD:</span> Grinding up the dry rice in a mortar and pestle to break it into smaller pieces and release more starch before simmering it on the stove can reduce overall cooking time by about 25 percent.</p>
<p class="noindent_para_ts"><span class="red3">THE LEFTOVER RICE METHOD:</span> Day-old leftover rice that’s spent the night in the refrigerator can be cooked into congee in about 30 minutes using the basic congee method, but cutting the amount of liquid to just 4 cups per cup of cooked rice. If you have the foresight to freeze the cooked rice, this cooking time can be cut down even further (a technique I learned from the excellent blog <i class="calibre9">The Woks of Life</i>). The process of freezing and thawing causes the rice grains to crack, releasing their starch much faster. You can take a cup of frozen rice, add it to 4 cups of water or stock in a saucepan, heat it up, and stir as it melts and comes to a boil. You end up with perfectly creamy congee in 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
