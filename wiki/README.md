# Wiki

This is based on [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) which I highly recommend if you want to make your own knowledge graph.

To make contributions to this wiki, I recommend that you use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and point it to the `contents/` folder in this directory. This will make connecting pages much easier. If you want to use vscode, there is the [Foam plugin](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) which can also do this.
