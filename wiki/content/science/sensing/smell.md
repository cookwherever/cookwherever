- Smells that enter nose and are "tasted" are Orthonasal Olfaction (aka aroma)
- Smells also can be tasted by the passageway from the back of the throat to the nose with Retronasal Olfaction (80% of what we perceive as flavor)


> Experiment:
> Hold your nose while you eat some food. Does the food taste different?
