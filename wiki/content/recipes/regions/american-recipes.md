title: American Cooking Basics
---

There are a number of meals that people regularly eat in America. Whether it is something you eat when you are pressed for time (which it seems like we always are) or preparing a meal for a special occasion. In both of these cases, eating something that turns out poorly is not a fun time and can discourage us from trying it again. 

Going down my own home cooking journey has led me to find a number of incredible resources from random blog posts to terse cookbooks that read more like textbooks. It is only through reading and then applying the skills I read about did things really start to click for me of how easy it really can be to whip something together to eat.

Recipes are amazing at guiding you through how to start with ingredients and sequentially put them together, but without really thinking about what you are doing, you are probably not going to become a "better cook". I really hope through this list of American food basics that you aren't just blindly following what is in the recipe, but rather using all of your senses to understand the transformation that your ingredients go through when you put them together in a recipe. I personally find it super liberating to be able to travel anywhere and be able to work with whatever I have on hand and not having to be dependent on specific amounts of a specific ingredient as far too often you cannot find every ingredient in a list.

These recipes also encourage you, when you have the time/equipment for it, to try out different techniques for preparing them. For example, did you know you can make scrambled eggs with a plastic bag, water, and precision cooker (otherwise known as _sous vide_ which is literally just a more powerful fish tank heater)? Understanding the different ways you can make these basic recipes will make you more versatile and allow you to confidently cook in any situation.
