Recipes take [[diets]] and transform them into a new food.

Typically, a recipe can be broken down into the following sections:
1. Title - The name of the recipe, typically has the main ingredient featured. Might have a colloquial name of the dish.
2. Ingredients - A list of foods that are to be used in the directions.
3. Directions - A list of steps to follow to prepare the ingredients 
4. Safe storage instructions
