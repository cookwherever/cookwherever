### Recipe
1. Heat milk to 115 F
	* Note: Bacteria like this temperature
2. Whisk in store bought yogurt
3. Place yogurt in a container and submerge in 120 degree water.

#### Without Sous-Vide Cooker
1. Place water in oven with another pot of boiling water
	-  Note: Heat will be constant and keep the bacteria happy
2. Wait at least 5 hours, up to 10 hours
	- Note: dan likes 8 hours
	* Note: Waiting longer will:
		1. Make the yogurt more acidic
		2. Make the yogurt more gel-like

### Substitutions
* For richer yogurt -> sub 1/2 cup of heavy cream for 1/2 of milk
* Denser, creamier yogurt -> 1/4 cup of non-fat milk powder into cold milk before heating it
* Greek yogurt -> Put [[cheesecloth]] over lid of jar and let it sit upside down in the fridge. Gravity will force water out through the cheesecloth and the yogurt solids will stay in the jar.

### Frozen Yogurt
* ATK - Ginger Frozen Yogurt
