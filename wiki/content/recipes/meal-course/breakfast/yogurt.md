title: Yogurt
---

* Heat milk to 115 F
	* Bacteria like this temperature
* Whisk in store bought yogurt
* Place yogurt in a container and submerge in 120 degree water.

#### Without Sous-Vide Cooker
* Place water in oven with another pot of boiling water
	*  Heat will be constant and keep the bacteria happy

* Wait at least 5 hours, up to 10 hours (dan likes 8 hours)
	* Waiting longer will:
		1. Make the yogurt more acidic
		2. Make the yogurt more gel-like

#### Substitutions
* For richer yogurt -> sub 1/2 cup of heavy cream for 1/2 of milk
* Denser, creamier yogurt -> 1/4 cup of non-fat milk powder into cold milk before heating it
* Greek yogurt -> Put [[cheesecloth]] over lid of jar and let it sit upside down in the fridge. Gravity will force water out through the cheesecloth and the yogurt solids will stay in the jar.

### Frozen Yogurt
* ATK - Ginger Frozen Yogurt
