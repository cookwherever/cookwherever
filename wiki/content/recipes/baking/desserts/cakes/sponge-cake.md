sponge cake = spongecake = sunshine cake Notes: Like sponges, these cakes have lots of air pockets, which are made by beating egg whites and folding them into the batter. Angel food cakes are similar, but they're made without egg yolks, while sponge cakes are made with whites and yolks. A sponge cake will keep its shape better if you cut it with a serrated knife. Substitutes: gï¿½noise (These are made with butter and have less sugar than sponge cakes. They're not as airy.) OR angel food cake OR ladyfingers (These are also used to make charlottes.) OR pound cake
