pound cake This is a rich buttery cake that's traditionally made with a pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. If you don't want to make one from scratch, you can find ready-made pound cakes among the frozen foods in your supermarket. Substitutes: butter cake (lighter texture) OR gï¿½noise (This absorbs flavors better than pound cake.) scone SKONE or SCAHN Notes: These crumbly quick breads are often served at teatime in Britain. They're usually split open and lathered with butter, jam, and/or clotted cream. Americans pronounce the name SKONE, but the British and Australians say SKAHN. They freeze well. Substitutes: English muffin OR shortcake shortcake = shortbread cake These sweetened biscuits are traditionally split in half and topped with whipped cream and strawberries. You can buy them ready-made in stores, where they're often displayed near the strawberries, but they're easy to make from scratch. Don't confuse shortcake with shortbread, a rich butter cookie. Substitutes: biscuits OR pound cake OR sponge cake
