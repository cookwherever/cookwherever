angel food cake = angel cake This is an airy white sponge cake made without egg yolks or any fat. It gets its volume from stiffly beaten egg whites, and it's normally baked in a tube pan. Many bakeries sell it ready-made. It will keep its shape better if you cut it with a serrated knife. Substitutes: sponge cake OR gï¿½noise OR pound cake
