g�noise = genoise = butter sponge cake = French butter sponge cake zhane-WAHZ Notes: This rich cake is light, pliable, and absorbent, so it forms the basis of many desserts, including tiramisu, baked Alaska, petits fours, and upside down cakes. You probably won't find them unembellished in markets, but they're easily made at home with cake flour, butter, eggs, vanilla, sugar, and salt. Substitutes: sponge cake OR ladyfingers (This is also commonly used in tiramisu.) OR pound cake (not as absorbent)
