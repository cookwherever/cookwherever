gingersnap = ginger biscuit These hard cookies are flavored with ginger and molasses. They're sometimes added to sauerbraten or beef stews, or they're crushed into crumbs for pie crusts. The British version of this is the ginger nut, which is similar but very hard. Substitutes: graham crackers (for pie crusts) OR chocolate wafers (for pie crusts) OR vanilla wafers (for pie crusts) OR gingerroot (for sauerbraten) OR ground ginger (for sauerbraten)
