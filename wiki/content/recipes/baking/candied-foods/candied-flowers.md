candied flowers Use clean, dry, edible, pesticide-free flowers. With a fork, beat together egg white from one egg and a teaspoon of water. Using a brush, paint the petals with the egg white, then set them on a plate covered with superfine sugar. Sprinkle some of the sugar on top of the petals and shake off the excess. Lay the petals on waxed paper and allow them to dry overnight.
