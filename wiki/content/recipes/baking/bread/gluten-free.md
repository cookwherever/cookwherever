Notes:
* Soaking grains make the starches softer
* Oil - Different oils change flavor
* Salt - Flavor
* Sugar - Flavor, speeds up yeast
* High power blender - Grains are hard to grind
* Too much heat will kill the yeast - Somewhere around 120 F
* 210F target internal temperature after baking
* Take it out of the pan to let the moister evaporate vs being trapped and making the crust on the bottom gummy
