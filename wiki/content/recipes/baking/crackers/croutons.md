croutons CREW-tahnz Notes: These add crunch to salads and soups. You can buy them readymade at many supermarkets, but they're much tastier if you make them yourself. To make your own: Brush cubes of crustless white bread with butter or olive, then season them with salt and other seasonings, like garlic (minced or powdered), parmesan cheese, or herbs. Place the cubes on a baking sheet and bake them in a 325Â° F oven until they're crisp, about 20 minutes. Substitutes: jicama (as a crunchy salad ingredient) OR Jerusalem artichokes (as a crunchy salad ingredient) OR friselle OR soup nuts (not as crunchy or flavorful) digestive biscuit = digestive These British crackers are similar to American graham crackers, only they're more crumbly and less sweet. They're often crushed into crumbs and used to make pie crusts. Substitutes: graham cracker OR wheatmeal biscuit (in Australia)
