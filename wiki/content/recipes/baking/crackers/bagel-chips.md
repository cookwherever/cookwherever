bagel chips You can buy these crunchy chips ready-made, but they're easy to make at home. To make your own: Slice bagels into very thin rounds and place them on a baking sheet. (They're easier to slice if they're cold.) Brush with butter or olive oil that's been seasoned with garlic powder or other herbs or spices. Bake in a 350ï¿½ oven until crisp and golden.
