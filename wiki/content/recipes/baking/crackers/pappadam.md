pappadam = papad = poppadum = pappadom PAH-pah-dum Notes: These tortilla-shaped Indian crackers are made with chickpea or lentil flour. Before you serve them, you need to fry them in very hot oil or heat them in a microwave oven until they puff up and become crisp. You can then break them up and serve them with curried dishes, or use them like tortilla chips. They're sold in Indian markets. Substitutes: cracker bread OR shrimp chips
