### Notes
- Bread is a ball of protein filled with gas (plus starch)
- Wheat is made of two proteins [[glutenin]] and [[gliadin]]
- Proteins link together with water to make a stretchy matrix, [[gluten]]
- Holes in bread are trapped air bubbles in gluten matrix in [[leavens|leavened]] bread

#### "Slow" bread
- uses [[yeast]], a living fungus, to consume sugars in the flour's starch and create carbon dioxide gas
- Released gas creates thousands of air pockets in dough, increasing the volume of the bread and making it rise
- Heating air pockets causes gas to expand (also known as "oven spring")
- When the gluten and starches reach specific temperatures, they come set and solidify the structure of the bread, or the [[crumb]]
- The bread turns from wet and stretchy, to dry and spongy
