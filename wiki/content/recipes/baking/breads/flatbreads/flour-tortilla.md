flour tortilla Notes: These thin flour wraps from northern Mexico are used to make burritos, chimichangas, fajitas and other Mexican dishes. They're more pliable than corn tortillas, so they're a good choice if you need to roll or fold the tortillas before cooking them. Flour tortillas come in different sizes, including small, thick "fajita tortillas" to large, thin "burrito tortillas." Substitutes: corn tortilla (These are lower in fat and less pliable. If using these to make enchiladas, soften them by dipping in warm chicken stock before rolling them.) OR chapati focaccia foh-KAH-chee-uh Notes: A focaccio is an Italian flatbread that resembles a pizza crust without the topping. Many cooks top it with cheese, onions, herbs, eggplant slices, and other ingredients before baking it, but you can also serve it plain. Substitutes: fougasse OR baked pizza crust OR bread dough (roll flat before baking)
