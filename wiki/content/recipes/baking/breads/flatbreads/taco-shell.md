taco shell These are crunchy corn tortillas that have been loosely folded and deep-fried. You just fill them and serve. Look for boxes of them among the Mexican foods in your supermarket, or make them yourself by deep-frying corn tortillas, forming them into a U-shape, then allowing them to harden into a crispy shell. Substitutes: corn tortilla (Using this converts a crispy taco into a "soft taco.") OR flour tortilla OR corn chips
