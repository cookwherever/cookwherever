### Notes
- defrosting
- thawing  

Freezing food doesn’t kill bacteria—it just puts them into suspended animation.  They start multiplying again when you take the food out of the freezer, and they can reproduce rapidly at any temperature within the so-called danger zone—[between 40° and 140°](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/danger-zone-40f-140f).   Think of defrosting as the start of a contest between you and the bacteria—your goal is to get the food cooked or eaten before they grow too numerous.   Food experts usually call the game in favor of the bacteria if perishable food has stayed in the danger zone for more than two hours.   

What difference does it make if I leave meat out to thaw on the counter all day—won’t cooking it kill most of the bacteria?

Cooking will indeed kill most of the bacteria, but you can still get food poisoning.  Some bacteria leave behind harmful toxins which aren’t destroyed by cooking.  

### Methods
#### Refrigerator
Put the wrapped frozen food in the refrigerator to thaw, with a tray beneath it to catch the drippings.  This method works especially well with meat—the slow thawing allows it to reabsorb much of the moisture from the melting ice crystals so there’s less “drip out.”  Thawing in the refrigerator also conserves energy since the frozen food helps cool your refrigerator as it thaws.   Food thawed this way doesn’t need to be cooked immediately.  It can even be refrozen if you change you mind about cooking it, though its quality may suffer.

If the temperature inside your freezer was above 40º for longer than 2 hours, then it’s best to throw out any perishable food that was inside.  Fortunately, your freezer probably stayed colder than that, especially if you had a lot of food in it and didn’t open the door.   If that’s the case, go ahead and refreeze everything.  Partially thawed meat and concentrated juices refreeze without much loss in quality, though fruits and vegetables get mushier.

#### Cold water
Put the food in a watertight plastic bag, and use cold water (lower than 70°) to thaw it.  The fastest and safest way to do this is to put the food in a sink or shower, and run the water over it, turning the package over every few minutes so that both sides thaw evenly.   If you want to conserve water, another method is to immerse the bag in a clean sink or bowl full of cold water.  Be sure to change the water every 30 minutes in order to keep it cold and flush out bacteria.  If you thaw food with cold water, you must cook it immediately—it would take too long for it to cool to a safe temperature if you put it in the refrigerator.    

> Tip: The more water you use and the more that water circulates, the faster your food will thaw.  If you often thaw food with cold water, think about buying a submersible aquarium pump to keep the water in the sink moving around the food.   Another thawing trick for small items it to put them in the washing machine, fill it with cold water, and use the delicate setting to agitate the water as the food thaws.   Don’t let the washer go into the spin cycle—on most washer models, you can disable this cycle by keeping the lid open. 

####  Microwave
Take the food out of its store packaging, put it in a microwave-safe container with loose wrapping on top, and microwave it on the defrost setting (30% power).  Make sure that you allow at least 2” between the food and the walls and ceiling of the microwave oven so that air can circulate properly.  If you’re thawing a package of individual pieces (like steaks or patties) that were frozen together, pull them apart as soon as you can and thaw them one at a time.  Every 5 minutes, you should rotate the food 180° so that it thaws more evenly.  After the food is thawed, be sure to cook it immediately—it would take too long for it to cool to a safe temperature if you put it in the refrigerator.  Once cooked, you can refreeze the food if you like.  Microwave ovens work best with small items.   See also:  microwave cooking

#### Cook it frozen
Just unwrap the food and cook it as if it were fresh, only allow more time for it to be cooked.  This method works best with fish, vegetables, prepared foods, and hamburger patties.  Use it for poultry, steaks and roasts only in a pinch—flouring and breading won’t stick to a frozen surface and the meat won’t sear properly.  See also:  searing meats; breading foods.

#### Metal pan
Food will thaw faster on metal than on a plastic or tile countertop—metal’s a better conductor so it transfers heat to the food more quickly.  Food safety experts frown on defrosting meat or fish this way.  It takes longer than other methods, giving bacteria more time to multiply.   Don’t even think of trying this with meat or fish if it will take longer than two hours to defrost.

> “Magic” defrosting trays:   There’s no magic or advanced science here—these overpriced space hogs are simply made of a metal (usually aluminum) that conducts heat fairly well.  Any heavy copper or aluminum pan should work just as well. 

#### Room temperature
Put the frozen item on the countertop and let it thaw at room temperature.  This is fine for some baked goods, but don’t ever use this method with meat or fish—bacteria thrive on these foods at room temperature.

> Air thawing tip:   Frozen foods will thaw faster if air is moving around them.  If you’re using the metal pan or room temperature method, you can speed things up quite a bit by blowing air on the food with an electric fan.

#### Warm water
Immerse the frozen food in warm water or run warm water over it.  This is a good way to thaw frozen juice cans, but don’t thaw meat or fish this way.
