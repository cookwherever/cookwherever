� The microwave method is a good one for small, unfrosted baked goods like bagels and muffins. It�s best to microwave them one at a time on high until they�re just thawed enough to cut in half (about 15 seconds), and then toast them briefly. If you can�t toast them, microwave them until heated through, about 30 seconds.
