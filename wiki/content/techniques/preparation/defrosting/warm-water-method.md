ï¿½ The warm water method is a good alternative. Submerge the can in warm water for a few minutes until the frozen juice is thawed enough to slide out of the can into a pitcher. It sometimes helps to puncture the closed end of the can in order to break the vacuum. Add some fresh water to the pitcher and mash the pulp with a potato masher.
