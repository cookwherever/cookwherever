title: Churning
---

* Beating air into [[cream]] and slamming fat globules against each other
* Over time, the air bubbles forced into the cream will attract the fat globules together and disrupt the membrane.
	* Imagine two bubbles coming together. When they touch each other, their surfaces will become joined.
* As more fat globules join together in this way, the process snowballs until one visible large mass can be seen.
