iron pan = iron skillet Iron distributes heat evenly, but tends to rust. Iron cookware should be seasoned before use. paraffin wax = canning wax = household wax = baker's wax Canners sometimes use this wax to seal jars, but it's hard to get a tight seal. It's safer and easier to use two-piece canning lids. Many grocers apply wax to fruits and vegetables to hold in moisture and make them shiny. Candy-makers sometimes use wax in their chocolates so that they hold up better in warm weather. spatula
