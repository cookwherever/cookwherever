## Ingredient Category Notes
### Vegetables
* Dense, starchy vegetables such as potatoes will take longer to cook than soft vegetables that contain a lot of water.
* Start at the low end of the cooking time and reseal the Instant Pot to cook further if necessary.

### Grains
* Foods which don’t remain distinct grains when cooked (ex. oats) should use the Natural Release method.
* Using the Quick Release method can send wet grains shooting up through the release valve.

### Beans and Legumes
* Cooking times can vary depending on the freshness or variety of the bean or legume.
* Start at the low end of the cooking time and increase as needed.
