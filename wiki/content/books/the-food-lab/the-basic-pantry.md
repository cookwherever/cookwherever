# Refrigerated Goods

## Fridge Organization Tips
* [[Fridge Thermometer]] monitors temperature when fridge or other systems fail.
* transfer food to small airtight containers- better organization, prevents air from spoiling food faster
* Labels- date and contents
* Prevent Drippage- Always store Raw meat on plate or tray
* Keep fish extra cold- fresh fish use immediately, if storing wrap in plastic and place between 2 ice packs, keep 32 degrees F or colder until use

## The Main Compartment 
#### Food Safety
* Minimize Risk by storing food that has a higher chance of getting you sick lower in the fridge. 
* The more likely possibility a food could make you sick/the higher the final temperature you intend to cook it to the lower in the refridgerater it should be. Benefits are colder temperatures to reduce harmful bacteria growth and contamination drippage.

#### Temperature

Fridges have cold and hot spots that range from 33-38 degrees Fahrenheit

Fridge temp set to 34 degrees and no part of fridge should rise above 39 degrees

Colder Spots
* back of bottom shelf, cold air falls
* back of top shelf, close to fan and condenser 

Warm Spots
* middle of the door

#### Humidity 
Important for vegetables to not dry out and stay fresh
* crisper drawers in fridge prevents fresh cold air from circulating
* vegetables release energy naturally which heats up drawer and allows for better moisture retention
