# 1 Eggs, Dairy, and the Science of Breakfast

## Eggs

### yolk
* 75% of calories in an egg
* Biologically they are sacks of water with dissolved proteins and larger masses of protein and fat linked together with lecithin
  * Lecithin is an emulsifying molecule which allows fat and water molecules to exist near each other without separating.
  
### white
* Mostly water with few proteins: Ovalbumin, Ovomucin, Ovotransferrin
* Proteins let egg white be whipped and come set when cooked (think of meringue)
* These proteins compared to others, such as those found in meat, are already dissolved in a liquid (there is a lot of water in an egg). This allows them to be easily included in other foods (gluten-free breads benefit from the structure these proteins provide when heated).
* Each protein reacts differently to heat allowing control over the resulting texture when cooking. 140 degrees F is soft and custard like and 180 degrees F is bouncy and firm

### sizing
* USDA sizing standards for minimum weight per egg
  * Jumbo - 2.5 oz
  * Extra large - 2.25 oz
  * Large - 2 oz
  * Medium - 1.75 oz
  * Small - 1.5 oz
  * PeeWee - 1.25 oz
* In larger eggs are more likely to find a double yolk

### grades
* USDA grading standards
  * AA - firmest whites, tallest standing yolks, cleanest shells
  * A - Somewhere between AA and B
  * B - Watery whites, flat yolks, stained shells
  * For preparing dishes with eggs as the focal point, a high quality 
    egg is preffered. When used in baking, the grade will not affect
    the result.

### Regulated Chicken Conditions
  * Natural / Farm Fresh - No regulated guaruntees
  * Free-Range, Free-Roaming, and Cage Free - Chickens are kept in large open barns/warehouses, not battery cages. More room for chickens to do things that they natually do. Labels are not audited, relying on producer to tell the truth.
  * Certified Organic - Kept in open barn or warehouse, possibly outdoor access. Must be fed organic, all-vegetarian diet without animal by-products, antibiotics, and pesticides. Label is audited by USDA.
  * Certified Humane - Third-party auditor enforces limits on stocking densities.
  * Omega-3-Enriched - Chickens are fed supplements from flaxseed or fish oil.

### freshness
* The fresher the egg, the more intact a yolk and white will be as the
  proteins have not had as much time to break down.
* To test how fresh an egg is, you can use a bowl of water and observe if it floats. If it floats then it is most likely bad and should not be used. Eggshells are porous and will lose water being in the fridge, a dehumidifier. The evaporated water will be replaced by air between the shell and the inner membrane near the end of the egg where the fat is stored. When the egg is fresh, this air pocket is small, but grows with time until it becomes large enough to cause the egg to become boyant in water.
* Aging eggs become more [alkaline](source), or basic, and can affect recipes which
  are affected by the pH of ingredients. In a meringue, the egg whites
  are whipped into stiffer peaks by a slightly acidic environment. 
  If the combined ingredients are not acidic enough, which can happen 
  with older eggs, the resulting mergine will be wet and more of a liquid.
  Cream of tartar is used to make the combined ingredients more acidic and
  counter this effect.
* Myth: Older eggs are easier to peel after they have been boiled.
  False: Older eggs simply produce less attractive boiled eggs as the yolks
  become uncentered in the egg.
* An egg can be safely used 60 to 70 days after the pack date. 
* The pack date is a more reliable method for determing how old an egg is. The pack date is a three-digit number directly above the sell-by date. The three numbers indicate the day of the year that it was packed on (ie. 001 is January 1st and 365 is December 31st). While it is not possible to determine exactly what day the eggs were laid, legally manufacturers have up to 30 days to clean and pack eggs. After this pack date, the sell-by date can be set up to 45 days later. Considering both these dates, buying a carton of eggs on their expiration date means they could be up to 75 days old.
* The cuticle of an egg is a thin, wax-like coating that exists on the egg when it is first laid. This is a protective coating for the incubating chick which prevents bacterial infection and moisture loss (since the shell is pourous). In the United States, USDA-stamped eggs have the cuticle removed before they are packed. With this protective layer removed, refrigeration is imparative to keep out bacterial infection. In farmers markets or Euorpean stores you can find this cuticle kept intact and eggs can be kept safely at room temperature.
* Pasturized eggs have been submerged in a 130F water bath for long enough to kill harmful bacteria 
* Color of an eggshell (white or brown) comes from the different breed of chicken.

### boiling 
* Definition: When vapor pressure of a liquid is greater than or equal to atmospheric pressure that surrounds it.
* Analogy: Water is made of molecules, in the same way a crowd at a concert is made of people. At a concert with a single piano player playing a soft ballad, the crowd will be silently listening, sitting in their seats. Replace this piano player with chaotic energy of a Van Halen solo shredding on his guitar, and the crowd will start to become active and possibly start _moshing_ or violently running into and pushing each other. If these enthusiastic concert goers are bound by some sort of barrier, it is possible they might break free and move into other parts of the venue. In a pot of water, it might not be obvious, but there is a barrier keeping these water molecules from escaping and it is the pressure from the atmosphere pushing down. As you add heat to the bottom of the pot, the water molecules nearest to the source of heat, just like people closest to the speakers at a concert, will start to get excited and bump into other molecules. Once the molecules all the way in the back, or at the top of the pot, start to get really excited, they break free and _evaporate_ in the form of steam or water vapor. Seeing their molecule friends escaping, the rest of the water in the pot starts to do the same. The temperature that water does this is at 212F or 100C. 

| Name | Temperature Range | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Quivering | 130F - 170F | Small bubbles of water vapor form at nucleation sites at the bottom of the pot. Surface of water quivers from bubbles attempting to surface, but not quite getting there. |
| Subsimmer | 170F - 195F | Small bubbles from the bottom and sides rise to the surface. Streams of small bubbles look like a champagne in a glass. |
| Simmer | 195F - 212F | Bubbles break surface of water regularly from all parts of the pot. |
| Full boil | 212F | Water vapor escapes rapidly and pot cannot get any hotter. A pressure cooker can increase the temperature beyond this point. |

* To more easily peel eggs, lower them into already boiling water instead 
  heating them from cold water. Eggs peel more easily when their proteins 
  are not bound to the shell.
* Types
	* Hard-boiled
		* White: Set, not rubbery
		* Yolk: Bright yellow and creamy yolk, not chalky or crumbly.
	* Soft-boiled
		* White: Set white
		* Yolk: Liquid, ooze like custard

### Heat and Eggs

Cooking eggs is crazy, there are so many ways to do it! We can thank the fact that there are so many different proteins which all respond to heat differently. Because of all the moving parts an an egg, time and temperature are very imporant to keep track of if you are looking to make the best eggs you have ever had.

![unraveling of egg protein](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/09/science/09SCI-MUNROE-EGG2/09SCI-MUNROE-EGG2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale)

> Proteins are essentially coiled balls of yarn. When you introduce them to heat, they start to unravel. Just like a box full of unravelled yarn, the unravelled proteins will overlap each other and create a thick mess. We call the process of a protein unravelling, *denaturing*. I like to think of all of these unravelled proteins as "chemistry noodles". 

#### Egg White and Temperature
What happens to the egg white as heat increases.

| Temperature Range | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 30F - 140F | The egg white's proteins begin to denature. |
| 140F | _Ovotransferrin_, a protein in the white, starts to unravel and bonds to itself. The result is a matrix of proteins which makes the white milkly and jelly-like. |
| 155F | _Ovotransferrin_ becomes an opaque solid. Egg white is soft and moist. |
| 180F | _Ovalbumin_, the main protein in the egg white, will cross-link and solidifiy. The egg white becomes firm, but remains tender. |
| > 180F | As temperature increases, the proteins will bond more tightly and will wring out water from the egg like when squeezing a wet towel. Hydrogen sulfide, or the "rotten egg smell", will form and your eggs just aren't going to smell good. |

#### Egg Yolk and Temperature
What happens to the egg yolk as heat increases.

| Temperature Range | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 145F | The proteins being to denature, making the yolk thicker. |
| 158F | Egg yolk is dark, translucent, and firm. Texture is like fudge. It can be cut with a fork. |
| 158F - 170F | Yolk becomes firmer until it turns pale and crumbly. |
| > 170F | More and more crumbly. The sulfer in the egg white and iron in the yolk react and create _ferrous sulfide_. This molecule makes the outside of the yolk turn slightly green.

| 4 minutes | White is opaque nearly all the way through but retains a bit of translucency next to the yolk; yolk is barely warm and completely raw | Serve as a topping to vegetables or grains; place on top of blanched asparagus or green beans or in a bowl of noodle soup. |
| 5 minutes | White is opaque but still quivering and barely set toward the yolk; yolk is warm but completely raw | Breakfast |
| 6 minutes | White is opaque, firm all the way through; yolk is warm and starting to firm up at the edges | Breakfast |
| 7 minutes | White is fully cooked and as hard as that of a hard-boiled egg; yolk is golden and liquid in the center but beginning to set around the edges	| Breakfast |

### Fried Eggs

#### Concepts
How do we have an egg white come set, which happens at around 155F, but the not overcook the egg yolk, which will start to become firm at 145F? Cooking two things at the same time with the same heat source is tricky, but thinking about chemistry and thermodynamics for a second (I promise it isn't anything too crazy!) we can figure out how to make the perfect fried egg.

Referring back to what we know about the chemistry of eggs, the yolk is filled with fat. Animals that live in cold climates use fat to keep themselves warm since fat is a good _insulator_. A good insulator will change temperature more slowly than a poor insulator, meaning it will become cold slowly _and_ become hot slowly. In science terms, an insulator transfers energy very inefficiently, or it is a poor _conductor_.

Additionally, if cracked carefully into the pan, the yolk will sit _on top of_ the white. All of the heat that the yolk will be affected by will have to go through the egg white first. Our egg white will also act as an insulator for our yolk!

#### Effect of Temperature on an Egg in a Pan

Let's take a look at what would happen if we put an egg in a pan heated to different temperatures.

| Temperature | Affect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low Heat    | Even though the yolk and white are insulated differently, the slow, steady heat of the pan will cause them to change temperature at nearly the same rate. This means we will see the yolk become completely firm and chalky before the egg white has a chance to become set. |
| Medium Heat | The egg yolk contains some amount of liquid on top, away from the heat of the pan, while the bottom, closer to the heat, has become firm. The white has become fully white and has started to brown.                                                                         |
| High Heat   | Egg whites become completely set, but because the yolk is well insulated, the heat has not had a chance to warm it up and so it is still all liquid.                                                                                                                         |

While you can cook an egg in a perfectly smooth, non-stick pan, it is a good idea to use some sort of oil or butter to make sure the egg won't stick as well as add more flavor/texture.

* Butter - Milk proteins will brown (more on browning [here](TODO)) and transfer to the egg giving it a rich taste
* Oil - Eggs are slightly more crispier, but with a cleaner taste.

By using a shallow pool of oil with your eggs, you can spoon some of the oil on top of the eggs so that they are being cooked from all sides. This will help cook the egg whites quickly white protecting our precious yolk from becoming too firm. 

#### Ingredients
* 2 large eggs
* 3 tbsp butter
  * Function: fat
  * Subs:
    * olive oil
* Salt and pepper

#### Equipment
* Pan
  * Surface: Non-stick
* Spoon
* Spatula
* Plate
* Optional: Paper towels

#### Directions
1. Heat fat in pan until...
  * Observe: if using olive oil, you start to see whisps of smoke.
  * Observe: if using butter, wait until the bubbling stops.
  * Also: place a paper towel on the plate. This will help absorb the oil from the eggs once they are done.
2. Crack eggs carefully right over top of the surface of the pan so that the yolk is sitting comfortably on top of the white.
3. Tilt the pan, barely, so that the fat pools to one side.
4. Scoop the fat onto the egg whites until they are set and crispy.
  * Time: 1 minute
5. Take the eggs out of the pan with a spatula and put them on the plate.

### Scrambled Eggs

#### Concepts

In any scrambled eggs recipe, the fatty egg yolk is first mixed together with the mainly protein white. While this mixture may seem simple, there are a number of moving parts which can greatly change the outcome. To understand how scrambled eggs can either be rich, dense, and creamy or light, slightly dry, and fluffy, it is important to consider the [chemistry of an egg](TODO) and [how water boils](TODO).

We know that eggs contain a lot of water

## Bacon
#### Concepts
More about [[ingredients/categories/land-animals/meat/pork/bacon/bacon|bacon as an ingredient]].

##### What is in bacon?
* Two main elements fat (mixture of fat and connective tissue) and lean, each cooks at different rates
* Fat shrinks when heated
* Remaining connective tissue is slowly broken down
	* Not fully breaking down connective tissue is what causes bacon to be "rubbery"
* Lean shrinks less than fat
* The difference in cooking rates is why bacon will curl and buckle
* Not keeping the bacon flat against the pan (as a result of curling or poor placement of the strip) makes the differences in cooking more pronounced 

##### Wet vs Dry Cure
* All bacon is [[curing|cured]]
	* Dry cure
		* Salt and other spices are rubbed on pork belly 
		* Over a few weeks, salt gets diffused throughout pork belly, meat loses moisture
		* Result is a deeply flavored belly as flavor has been concentrated by lost water
	* Wet cure
		* Saltwater solution is injected into meat
		* Salt can travel through meat more easily, only requires days to cure
		* Resulting belly does not have enough time to drive off water, but instead takes on more water
		* You receive less belly than what you are seeing compared to dry cure bacon due to the water weight
		* 1lb package has at least 1 or 2oz of water weight
	* Wet cure bacon will curl more as there is more water that evaporates and sputters more grease because of the water rapidly evaporating 

##### Even cooking
* Low heat, even heat distribution prevents curling and keeps bacon in contact with pan
	* Large heavy skillet made from metal that allows even heat distribution is good for this
	* Baking sheet in oven also works well, also lets you cook more bacon simultaneously
* Cutting bacon in half helps prevent the bacon from curling as much

##### Notes
[1] How to rotate baking sheets

Caution: Moving hot baking sheets with grease can be dangerous. Use oven mitts to protect your hands.

1. Make sure the top of the oven is cleared (or find some clear area in your kitchen where you can place very hot things, you may place down cotton towels, oven mitts, or some other object to insulate from the heat of the baking sheet)
2. Take the baking sheet on the top rack out of the oven and place on the top of the oven
3. Take the baking sheet on the bottom rack out and rotate it so that you are holding the edge of the sheet that was further away from you
4. Place this sheet back into the oven
5. Take the sheet that you took out and rotate it in the same way as the other sheet so the further edge is closer to you
6. Place sheet back into oven

## Crispy Potato Cake
### Concepts
* Also known as a rösti
* Outside is crispy and golden brown, inside is creamy and tender
* It is important to balance starch in the potato cake
	* Too much starch and it is sticky
	* Too little and it falls apart
* Starch is held in cell walls of the potato, cutting releases the starch
* Avoid rinsing potato shreds as they do not soften properly when cooked

#### Method of cutting potato is important
* Using a box grater or food processor will rupture too many cell walls, releasing too much liquid and starch
* You can squeeze the shreds dry, but potato cake will be starchy and sticky
* Using a mandolin is more difficult than the other methods, but will result in a better potato cake
* A 1/16-inch blade will cut the correctly sized shreds or a larger sized blade and then using a sharp knife to cut them into planks
* Sharper blades and less cutting = less cell walls breaking = less sticky starch being released = better texture and more potato flavor

#### Parcook Potatos before Frying
* Prevents oxidation 
	* After potatoes are cut, in 15 minutes the color will change from pale white, to reddish brown, and then to black
	* Storing sliced potatoes in water will slow down this process, but washes away starch
* A microwave is effective at parcooking the sliced potatos because it does it quickly without adding or losing too much moisture
