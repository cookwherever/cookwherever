# 1 Eggs, Dairy, and the Science of Breakfast

## Eggs

Learn more about eggs as an [[ingredients/categories/land-animals/eggs/eggs|ingredient]]

### yolk
* 75% of calories in an egg
* Biologically they are sacks of water with dissolved proteins and larger masses of protein and fat linked together with lecithin
  * Lecithin is an emulsifying molecule which allows fat and water molecules to exist near each other without separating.
  
### white
* Mostly water with few proteins: Ovalbumin, Ovomucin, Ovotransferrin
* Proteins let egg white be whipped and come set when cooked (think of meringue)
* These proteins compared to others, such as those found in meat, are already dissolved in a liquid (there is a lot of water in an egg). This allows them to be easily included in other foods (gluten-free breads benefit from the structure these proteins provide when heated).
* Each protein reacts differently to heat allowing control over the resulting texture when cooking. 140 degrees F is soft and custard like and 180 degrees F is bouncy and firm

### sizing
* USDA sizing standards for minimum weight per egg
  * Jumbo - 2.5 oz
  * Extra large - 2.25 oz
  * Large - 2 oz
  * Medium - 1.75 oz
  * Small - 1.5 oz
  * PeeWee - 1.25 oz
* In larger eggs are more likely to find a double yolk

### grades
* USDA grading standards
  * AA - firmest whites, tallest standing yolks, cleanest shells
  * A - Somewhere between AA and B
  * B - Watery whites, flat yolks, stained shells
  * For preparing dishes with eggs as the focal point, a high quality 
    egg is preffered. When used in baking, the grade will not affect
    the result.

### Regulated Chicken Conditions
  * Natural / Farm Fresh - No regulated guaruntees
  * Free-Range, Free-Roaming, and Cage Free - Chickens are kept in large open barns/warehouses, not battery cages. More room for chickens to do things that they natually do. Labels are not audited, relying on producer to tell the truth.
  * Certified Organic - Kept in open barn or warehouse, possibly outdoor access. Must be fed organic, all-vegetarian diet without animal by-products, antibiotics, and pesticides. Label is audited by USDA.
  * Certified Humane - Third-party auditor enforces limits on stocking densities.
  * Omega-3-Enriched - Chickens are fed supplements from flaxseed or fish oil.

### freshness
* The fresher the egg, the more intact a yolk and white will be as the
  proteins have not had as much time to break down.
* To test how fresh an egg is, you can use a bowl of water and observe if it floats. If it floats then it is most likely bad and should not be used. Eggshells are porous and will lose water being in the fridge, a dehumidifier. The evaporated water will be replaced by air between the shell and the inner membrane near the end of the egg where the fat is stored. When the egg is fresh, this air pocket is small, but grows with time until it becomes large enough to cause the egg to become boyant in water.
* Aging eggs become more [alkaline](source), or basic, and can affect recipes which
  are affected by the pH of ingredients. In a meringue, the egg whites
  are whipped into stiffer peaks by a slightly acidic environment. 
  If the combined ingredients are not acidic enough, which can happen 
  with older eggs, the resulting mergine will be wet and more of a liquid.
  Cream of tartar is used to make the combined ingredients more acidic and
  counter this effect.
* Myth: Older eggs are easier to peel after they have been boiled.
  False: Older eggs simply produce less attractive boiled eggs as the yolks
  become uncentered in the egg.
* An egg can be safely used 60 to 70 days after the pack date. 
* The pack date is a more reliable method for determing how old an egg is. The pack date is a three-digit number directly above the sell-by date. The three numbers indicate the day of the year that it was packed on (ie. 001 is January 1st and 365 is December 31st). While it is not possible to determine exactly what day the eggs were laid, legally manufacturers have up to 30 days to clean and pack eggs. After this pack date, the sell-by date can be set up to 45 days later. Considering both these dates, buying a carton of eggs on their expiration date means they could be up to 75 days old.
* The cuticle of an egg is a thin, wax-like coating that exists on the egg when it is first laid. This is a protective coating for the incubating chick which prevents bacterial infection and moisture loss (since the shell is pourous). In the United States, USDA-stamped eggs have the cuticle removed before they are packed. With this protective layer removed, refrigeration is imparative to keep out bacterial infection. In farmers markets or Euorpean stores you can find this cuticle kept intact and eggs can be kept safely at room temperature.
* Pasturized eggs have been submerged in a 130F water bath for long enough to kill harmful bacteria 
* Color of an eggshell (white or brown) comes from the different breed of chicken.

### boiling 
* Definition: When vapor pressure of a liquid is greater than or equal to atmospheric pressure that surrounds it.
* Analogy: Water is made of molecules, in the same way a crowd at a concert is made of people. At a concert with a single piano player playing a soft ballad, the crowd will be silently listening, sitting in their seats. Replace this piano player with chaotic energy of a Van Halen solo shredding on his guitar, and the crowd will start to become active and possibly start _moshing_ or violently running into and pushing each other. If these enthusiastic concert goers are bound by some sort of barrier, it is possible they might break free and move into other parts of the venue. In a pot of water, it might not be obvious, but there is a barrier keeping these water molecules from escaping and it is the pressure from the atmosphere pushing down. As you add heat to the bottom of the pot, the water molecules nearest to the source of heat, just like people closest to the speakers at a concert, will start to get excited and bump into other molecules. Once the molecules all the way in the back, or at the top of the pot, start to get really excited, they break free and _evaporate_ in the form of steam or water vapor. Seeing their molecule friends escaping, the rest of the water in the pot starts to do the same. The temperature that water does this is at 212F or 100C. 

| Name | Temperature Range | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Quivering | 130F - 170F | Small bubbles of water vapor form at nucleation sites at the bottom of the pot. Surface of water quivers from bubbles attempting to surface, but not quite getting there. |
| Subsimmer | 170F - 195F | Small bubbles from the bottom and sides rise to the surface. Streams of small bubbles look like a champagne in a glass. |
| Simmer | 195F - 212F | Bubbles break surface of water regularly from all parts of the pot. |
| Full boil | 212F | Water vapor escapes rapidly and pot cannot get any hotter. A pressure cooker can increase the temperature beyond this point. |

* To more easily peel eggs, lower them into already boiling water instead 
  heating them from cold water. Eggs peel more easily when their proteins 
  are not bound to the shell.
* Types
	* Hard-boiled
		* White: Set, not rubbery
		* Yolk: Bright yellow and creamy yolk, not chalky or crumbly.
	* Soft-boiled
		* White: Set white
		* Yolk: Liquid, ooze like custard

### Heat and Eggs

Cooking eggs is crazy, there are so many ways to do it! We can thank the fact that there are so many different proteins which all respond to heat differently. Because of all the moving parts an an egg, time and temperature are very imporant to keep track of if you are looking to make the best eggs you have ever had.

![unraveling of egg protein](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/09/science/09SCI-MUNROE-EGG2/09SCI-MUNROE-EGG2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale)

> Proteins are essentially coiled balls of yarn. When you introduce them to heat, they start to unravel. Just like a box full of unravelled yarn, the unravelled proteins will overlap each other and create a thick mess. We call the process of a protein unravelling, *denaturing*. I like to think of all of these unravelled proteins as "chemistry noodles". 

#### Egg White and Temperature
What happens to the egg white as heat increases.

| Temperature Range | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 30F - 140F | The egg white's proteins begin to denature. |
| 140F | _Ovotransferrin_, a protein in the white, starts to unravel and bonds to itself. The result is a matrix of proteins which makes the white milkly and jelly-like. |
| 155F | _Ovotransferrin_ becomes an opaque solid. Egg white is soft and moist. |
| 180F | _Ovalbumin_, the main protein in the egg white, will cross-link and solidifiy. The egg white becomes firm, but remains tender. |
| > 180F | As temperature increases, the proteins will bond more tightly and will wring out water from the egg like when squeezing a wet towel. Hydrogen sulfide, or the "rotten egg smell", will form and your eggs just aren't going to smell good. |

#### Egg Yolk and Temperature
What happens to the egg yolk as heat increases.

| Temperature Range | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 145F | The proteins being to denature, making the yolk thicker. |
| 158F | Egg yolk is dark, translucent, and firm. Texture is like fudge. It can be cut with a fork. |
| 158F - 170F | Yolk becomes firmer until it turns pale and crumbly. |
| > 170F | More and more crumbly. The sulfer in the egg white and iron in the yolk react and create _ferrous sulfide_. This molecule makes the outside of the yolk turn slightly green.

### Whipping Egg Whites
[[meringue]] - egg whites that have been whipped to the point that they exist in a semisolid foam

When whipping egg whites, there are a number of states that whipped egg whites will go through. Understanding what happens at these states can help you figure out where you are in the process/figure out what went wrong.

A _peak_ in a meringue refers to taking a utensil (a whisk, spatula, etc.), place it into the whipped egg whites, pulling it out, and observing the tiny mountain, or _peak_, of egg whites that were formed. If the peak starts to fall over a bit, then the peaks are _soft_. If the peak keeps it shape rigidly, then the peaks are _stiff_.

| State of Whipping     | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Foam                  | The [[globulin]] and [[ovotransferrin]] proteins begin to unfold and form into small groups. Air is trapped in the groups of proteins as air bubbles. |
| Soft peaks            | The groups of proteins connect with each other creating a network with reinforced walls. More air bubbles are trapped in the network, and still are mostly visible. |
| Stiff peaks           | The air bubbles are too small to see with human eyes, and the egg whites look white and opaque like shaving cream. |
| Breakdown and weeping | Continuing to beat the egg whites will make the network of proteins come too close together and squeeze out the moisture. Acidic ingredients (cream of tartar, lemon juice, etc) prevent the protein network from ever being able to bond too tightly.                                                                                                                                                     |

### Fried Eggs

#### Concepts
How do we have an egg white come set, which happens at around 155F, but the not overcook the egg yolk, which will start to become firm at 145F? Cooking two things at the same time with the same heat source is tricky, but thinking about chemistry and thermodynamics for a second (I promise it isn't anything too crazy!) we can figure out how to make the perfect fried egg.

Referring back to what we know about the chemistry of eggs, the yolk is filled with fat. Animals that live in cold climates use fat to keep themselves warm since fat is a good _insulator_. A good insulator will change temperature more slowly than a poor insulator, meaning it will become cold slowly _and_ become hot slowly. In science terms, an insulator transfers energy very inefficiently, or it is a poor _conductor_.

Additionally, if cracked carefully into the pan, the yolk will sit _on top of_ the white. All of the heat that the yolk will be affected by will have to go through the egg white first. Our egg white will also act as an insulator for our yolk!

#### Effect of Temperature on an Egg in a Pan

Let's take a look at what would happen if we put an egg in a pan heated to different temperatures.

| Temperature | Affect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low Heat    | Even though the yolk and white are insulated differently, the slow, steady heat of the pan will cause them to change temperature at nearly the same rate. This means we will see the yolk become completely firm and chalky before the egg white has a chance to become set. |
| Medium Heat | The egg yolk contains some amount of liquid on top, away from the heat of the pan, while the bottom, closer to the heat, has become firm. The white has become fully white and has started to brown.                                                                         |
| High Heat   | Egg whites become completely set, but because the yolk is well insulated, the heat has not had a chance to warm it up and so it is still all liquid.                                                                                                                         |

While you can cook an egg in a perfectly smooth, non-stick pan, it is a good idea to use some sort of oil or butter to make sure the egg won't stick as well as add more flavor/texture.

* Butter - Milk proteins will brown (more on browning [here](TODO)) and transfer to the egg giving it a rich taste
* Oil - Eggs are slightly more crispier, but with a cleaner taste.

By using a shallow pool of oil with your eggs, you can spoon some of the oil on top of the eggs so that they are being cooked from all sides. This will help cook the egg whites quickly white protecting our precious yolk from becoming too firm. 

#### Ingredients
* 2 large eggs
* 3 tbsp butter
  * Function: fat
  * Subs:
    * olive oil
* Salt and pepper

#### Equipment
* Pan
  * Surface: Non-stick
* Spoon
* Spatula
* Plate
* Optional: Paper towels

#### Directions
1. Heat fat in pan until...
  * Observe: if using olive oil, you start to see whisps of smoke.
  * Observe: if using butter, wait until the bubbling stops.
  * Also: place a paper towel on the plate. This will help absorb the oil from the eggs once they are done.
2. Crack eggs carefully right over top of the surface of the pan so that the yolk is sitting comfortably on top of the white.
3. Tilt the pan, barely, so that the fat pools to one side.
4. Scoop the fat onto the egg whites until they are set and crispy.
  * Time: 1 minute
5. Take the eggs out of the pan with a spatula and put them on the plate.

### Scrambled Eggs

#### Concepts

In any scrambled eggs recipe, the fatty egg yolk is first mixed together with the mainly protein white. While this mixture may seem simple, there are a number of moving parts which can greatly change the outcome. To understand how scrambled eggs can either be rich, dense, and creamy or light, slightly dry, and fluffy, it is important to consider the [chemistry of an egg](TODO) and [how water boils](TODO).

We know that eggs contain a lot of water

#### Variations

| Fillings | 	Prep |
|------------|-----------------|
| Young cheeses of all kinds (I like cheddar, Jack, blue, feta, Gruyère, Brie, and goat cheeses) | Grate or crumble. If using in conjunction with other cooked ingredients, toss with them in a small bowl after parcooking them; the residual heat will help start the melting process. |
| Hard grating cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano, Cotija, and Pecorino Romano | Grate on a Microplane and add to the raw eggs. |
| Cured meats like sausage, ham, and bacon | Cut into ½-inch pieces or nuggets and parcook in butter (let bacon cook in its own fat) until crisp on the edges and well browned. |
| Firm vegetables like onions, shallots, bell peppers, and hot peppers | Dice and soften in butter. |
|Tomatoes | Dice, salt, and drain. |
| Tender leafy vegetables like spinach and arugula | Sauté in butter, with a bit of minced garlic if desired. |
| Tender squashes like zucchini and summer squash | Sauté in butter. |
| Asparagus |	Cut into 1/4-inch slices on the bias and sauté in butter. |
| Scallions | Thinly slice whites and sauté in butter; thinly slice greens and incorporate into the filling or reserve for garnish. |
| Mushrooms | Slice thin and sauté in butter until the moisture has evaporated and the mushrooms are well browned. |
| [[herbs]] | Add directly to the raw eggs. |

## Bacon
#### Concepts
More about [[ingredients/categories/land-animals/meat/pork/bacon/bacon|bacon as an ingredient]].

##### What is in bacon?
* Two main elements fat (mixture of fat and connective tissue) and lean, each cooks at different rates
* Fat shrinks when heated
* Remaining connective tissue is slowly broken down
	* Not fully breaking down connective tissue is what causes bacon to be "rubbery"
* Lean shrinks less than fat
* The difference in cooking rates is why bacon will curl and buckle
* Not keeping the bacon flat against the pan (as a result of curling or poor placement of the strip) makes the differences in cooking more pronounced 

##### Wet vs Dry Cure
* All bacon is [[curing|cured]]
	* Dry cure
		* Salt and other spices are rubbed on pork belly 
		* Over a few weeks, salt gets diffused throughout pork belly, meat loses moisture
		* Result is a deeply flavored belly as flavor has been concentrated by lost water
	* Wet cure
		* Saltwater solution is injected into meat
		* Salt can travel through meat more easily, only requires days to cure
		* Resulting belly does not have enough time to drive off water, but instead takes on more water
		* You receive less belly than what you are seeing compared to dry cure bacon due to the water weight
		* 1lb package has at least 1 or 2oz of water weight
	* Wet cure bacon will curl more as there is more water that evaporates and sputters more grease because of the water rapidly evaporating 

##### Even cooking
* Low heat, even heat distribution prevents curling and keeps bacon in contact with pan
	* Large heavy skillet made from metal that allows even heat distribution is good for this
	* Baking sheet in oven also works well, also lets you cook more bacon simultaneously
* Cutting bacon in half helps prevent the bacon from curling as much

### Pan Fried Bacon

##### Notes
[1] How to rotate baking sheets

Caution: Moving hot baking sheets with grease can be dangerous. Use oven mitts to protect your hands.

1. Make sure the top of the oven is cleared (or find some clear area in your kitchen where you can place very hot things, you may place down cotton towels, oven mitts, or some other object to insulate from the heat of the baking sheet)
2. Take the baking sheet on the top rack out of the oven and place on the top of the oven
3. Take the baking sheet on the bottom rack out and rotate it so that you are holding the edge of the sheet that was further away from you
4. Place this sheet back into the oven
5. Take the sheet that you took out and rotate it in the same way as the other sheet so the further edge is closer to you
6. Place sheet back into oven

## Crispy Potato Cake
### Concepts
* Also known as a rösti
* Outside is crispy and golden brown, inside is creamy and tender
* It is important to balance starch in the potato cake
	* Too much starch and it is sticky
	* Too little and it falls apart
* Starch is held in cell walls of the potato, cutting releases the starch
* Avoid rinsing potato shreds as they do not soften properly when cooked

#### Method of cutting potato is important
* Using a box grater or food processor will rupture too many cell walls, releasing too much liquid and starch
* You can squeeze the shreds dry, but potato cake will be starchy and sticky
* Using a mandolin is more difficult than the other methods, but will result in a better potato cake
* A 1/16-inch blade will cut the correctly sized shreds or a larger sized blade and then using a sharp knife to cut them into planks
* Sharper blades and less cutting = less cell walls breaking = less sticky starch being released = better texture and more potato flavor

#### Parcook Potatos before Frying
* Prevents oxidation 
	* After potatoes are cut, in 15 minutes the color will change from pale white, to reddish brown, and then to black
	* Storing sliced potatoes in water will slow down this process, but washes away starch
* A microwave is effective at parcooking the sliced potatos because it does it quickly without adding or losing too much moisture

### Variations 

## Pancakes
### Concepts
#### Bread
See notes on [[breads]]
### Leavening a Quick Bread
See notes on [[baking-soda]]
- [[baking-powder]] does not create enough gas to leaven a thicker dough, dough of a quick bread must be very moist and loose
- A quick bread has more of a [[batter]] than a [[doughs|dough]] which means there is little gluten formation
- Making batter will immediately cause baking soda to start reacting and creating bubbles
- _Batter should be cooked immediately after making_ 
	- Immediately cooking: light, tall, fluffy
	- Waiting: dense, gummy, with few bubbles
### Browning
- [[maillard reaction]] is the reason why pancakes are brown
- Baking soda will create a more [[alkaline]] environment which helps browning
	- After the baking soda has been neutralized by the acidic buttermilk, the rest will go towards browning the pancake 
- Too little baking soda will make pancake pale, too much will brown too fast and leave a soapy, chemical aftertaste from the baking soda that has not been neutralized
- Cookies will sometimes use baking soda by itself to improve browning

### Variations 
- Orange-scented
- Maple Bacon

## Ricotta
### Concepts
- _Ricotta_ means "recooked"
- Made by adding acid to heated whey
	- Whey is typically from Pecorino Romano production
- Heat and acid binds proteins in milk together
	- Mostly the casein protein
- Bound proteins trap moisture and fat resulting in soft, white curds
- Curds are removed from the milk
	- When drained, flavor is concentrated and texture is emphasized
- Store bough ricotta is not drained
	- The process of draining has to be done carefully to avoid damaging the curds, this can be expensive.
	- Result is a rubbery paste
- Ricotta should be creamy, tender and a tang from the acid added during cooking

#### Acid added during cooking
- Buttermilk
	- 1:4 ratio is needed to curdle milk, which imparts strong sour flavor
- Distilled vinegar
	- 5% acetic acid
	- Clean flavor
	- Consistent with fresh milk
		- Mlik gets more acidic over time
- Lemon juice
	- Acidity is not consistent, amount may vary based on lemon
	- Imparts slight citrius flavor

#### Affect of Draining Time on Texture
| Time | Texture | Best Uses |
| ---- | ------- | --------- |
| < 5 min | Moist and creamy with small, tender curds. Similar to cottage cheese | Use immediately. Serve with olive oil, salt, pepper. Dessert with honey and fruit. |
| 15 to 20 min | Moist and spreadable. Not runny. | Moist and savory (lasagna, pizza). Pancake batter. |
| 2 to 8 hours (refrigerated) | Large, dry, crumbly curds. Moldable. | Cakes and pasta. |

#### Pasturizing Milk Techniques
| Technique | Temperature | Time | Notes |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- | ----- |
| Regular | 161°F | 20 seconds | Few weeks of shelf life. Most supermarket milk. |
| Ultra High Temperature (UHT) | 275°F | 1 second | Several month shelf life (in a proper container, can be unrefrigerated for years). |
| Low-Temperature | 145°F | 30 minutes | Small farms use this method. Does not impart "cooked" flavor. Packaging will not indicate this method is used. |

- Higher temperature used when pasteurizing milk, the more breakdown in proteins and sugars
	- Complex carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, which taste sweet
- UHT does not coagulate as well

### Equipment
- Cheesecloth
	- Sub: Paper towels
- Large bowl
- 2-quart measuring cup
- Slotted spoon
	- Sub: Wire skimmer
- Plastic wrap
### Ingredients
- 4 cups whole milk
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
	- Sub: Lemon juice 

### Directions
1. Line colander with four layers of cheesecloth
2. Place colander over large bowl
3. Combine milk, salt, vinegar in 2-quart measuring cup
4. Microwave
	- Temperature: High
	- Time: 4 minutes
	- Until: Bubbling around edges or milk is 165°F
5. Remove measuring cup from microwave
6. Stir gently
	- Time: 5 seconds
	- Observe: Milk separates into curds, solid white, and liquid whey, translucent
7. If not seperated after stiring, microwave
	- Temperature: High
	- Time: 30 seconds
	- Repeat: Until milk separates into curds
8. Transfer curds with slotted spoon to colander
9. Cover colander with plastic wrap
10. Drain
	- Until: Desired texture (see table)

### Storage
Covered in refrigerator up to 5 days

## Biscuits
### Concepts
- batter and dough
	- flour
	- butter
	- baking powder
	- baking soda
	- liquid dairy 
- batter
	- fluffy, tender, flat
	- butter is melted and added
	- flour + water = gluten
- dough
	- tall, flaky, crisp
	- butter is added while it is cold
	- flour + just butter = less gluten
- fat from butter gets in the way of the gluten network from growing
- you want to form some gluten so things hold, but too much and biscuits will be tough
- rolling out biscuit squishes the chunks of butter into flat, thin layers (this is what gives biscuts their layers)
#### Baking
- butter melts, leaving fat while the water is vaporized
- Vaporized water from the butter and dough create a bubble that expands, creating an expanded space in the gluten network
- Baking powder and soda also leaven the dough, adding more spaces in the network
- As the water is removed from the dough, the starches from the flour become hard and the biscuit starts to come set and hold its shape
- The expanded spaces now hold their shape on their own

#### Folding
- Handling the dough more will transfer heat into the dough, warming up the butter, and increase the amount of gluten being formed
	- Butter that is warmed up will start to seep out water, which is absorbed by the flour and converted to gluten
	- Pressing the dough over and over will cause more gluten to form
- Food processing butter into the flour will chop up the butter quickly, without transfering heat into the dough
- Folding the dough onto itself will increase the number of layers of butter and flour
	- Think about croissants and puff pasteries, biscuit layers are not as volumous, but are essentially the same
- Scone is essentially a sweetend biscuit

    - Note: Use a bench scraper to lift dough from work surface.
	- Note: Visualizing the dough split into thirds, fold the left section over the middle section, fold the right section over the folded left section, so that all the sections overlap each other. You will end up with a 12 inch by 4 inch rectangle.
17. Laminate dough
    - Note: Use a bench scraper to lift dough from work surface.
	- Note: Visualizing the dough split into thirds, fold the top section over the middle section, fold the bottom section over the folded top section, all sections will overlap each other. You will end up with a 4 inch square.

### Variations 
- Cheddar cheese and scallion 
- Bacon parmesan
- Flaky scone

## Sticky Buns
### Concepts
- enriched dough
	- standard dough (flour, water, salt, leavener) + fat
	- eggs and butter
	- milk and yogurt also introduce fat
- less fat
	- more gluten
	- stronger network
	- larger holes in crumb
	- chewier
- more fat
	- fat gets in the way of gluten forming (water + flour), breaks up continuous network
	- softer
	- richer
- gluten is kind of like noodles (noodles are made up of gluten, so they are like larger gluten network lol)
	- noodles that have just been cooked in water are somewhat sticky. They clump and cling to each other to create a cohesive mass that wants to stay with each other.
	- Once you put butter, oil, or some other fat on the noodles, they start to slide around each other more easily. They no longer clump as much.
- yeast consumes sugars and turns them into carbon dioxide (trapped in the gluten network to form bubbles), alcohol, and aromatic flavors
	- chemically leavening bread with baking soda compromises flavor
- add too much yeast and the flavor is bitter and distincly "yeasty"
