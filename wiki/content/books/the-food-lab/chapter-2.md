# Soups, Stews, And The Science of Stock

## Stock

### What's a Chicken?

#### Muscle

* Meat of the chicken
* Can be divided into two categories: **fast twitch** and **slow twitch**
* Fast twitch
  * Used for short bursts of energy
  * Found in chicken breasts, used to move the wings in a dire situation
  * Less dense with capillaries, making them pale

* Slow twitch
  * Used for sustained movement, like walking
  * Found in legs and thighs, to keep the chicken standing
  * More dense with capillaries, making the meat look darker

* This separation of muscle types can be found in most animals, even humans

#### Fat
* Provides insulation and allows for the storing of energy for chicklens
* Found around the legs and back of the chicken, and in the skin

#### Connective Tissue
* Constructed of the protein collagen
* Attaches muscles to bones, and bones to each other
* When heated, connective tissue dissolves into *gelatin*, giving the stock texture
* Particularly concentrated in the legs, wings, back, and skin for the chicken

#### Bone
  * Gives the bird structure
  * Some believe that bones are what give the stock flavor, but this may not be true
* Meat-based stocks will have more flavor but no body
* Bone-based stocks will have moderate amounts of body, but no flavor
* Using chicken carcasses, which has a good amount of bones and connective tissue, but less meat, creates a stock that is flavorfull and has a solid structure, due to the higher amount of gelatin extracted during simmering

* Carcasses are the best balance between a good flavor and a body, which is also the cheapest way to source chicken
* Extracting flavor from carcasses involves squeezing it out of chicken muscles
* This process can be expedited by cutting up or grinding the carcasses, as the length of the tubes is shortened
* <!--- Image of cut up chicken here? -->
* This doesn't affect body development, because extracting gelatin is a chemical process that takes time

## Extracting Gelatin 

* <!--- graph of flavor and body vs temperature here? -->
* It takes about 3 hours for 90% of a chicken's connective tissue to convert into gelatin at a 190-200°F simmer, and about another hour to fully convert
* Beyond this point, the gelatin itself will start to break down, losing its ability to thicken the stock
* This means that a chicken stock should ideally be simmered for about 4 hours
* Another option is to use store-bought gelatin
* <!--- Image of gelatin product? -->
* With store-bought gelatin, you can get away with simmering your broth for only 45 minutes, since you don't need to wait for the gelatin to be extracted

## Experiment: Fat = Flavor	

### Concept

* Meat gets most of its flavor from the fat around and within it
* This is why lean meat is sometimes described as tasting like chicken, because meat has a generic taste without fat

### Materials

* 12 ounces boneless lean beef  cut into 1-inch cubes
* 1 ounce beef fat, trimmed from a steak  cut into small pieces
* 1 ounce lamb fat trimmed from a lamb chop 
* 1 ounce bacon cut into small pieces
* Food processor

### Method

1. Split the beef into 3 portions, and toss each portion with a different fat
2. Grind the meat into a hamburger using a food processer
3. Form each portion into a patty, and cook it on a grill or hot skillet
4. Taste each patty

### Results

* Even though the beef used in the patties were from the same source, each burger will taste like the fat it came from (ex. the beef cooked with lamb fat will taste like a lamb burger), showing that the flavor of the meat mainly comes from the fat

## Defatting a Stock

* One must be careful not to add to much fat, because that leads to a greasy flavor and an oily taste
* One method to defat a stock is to strain it through a fine-mesh strainer and let it rest
* Another method is to refrigerate the stock, which crystallizes the fat into an easy-to-remove layer

## STOCK, BROTH, GLACE, AND JUS 

* <!--- Title? -->
* Stock is different from broth because stock is made by simmering bones, connective tissue, and other parts in water
* One can reduce a stock by slowly heating it to evaporate its water content, concentrating flavorful compounds and gelatin
* Reduced enough, the stock becomes *glace*, a viscous liquid used as coating on food
* On the other hand, broth is made without bones and connective tissue; just meat and vegetables
* Without collagen from connective tissue, it has the viscosity of water
* Jus is the natural juice released by meat as it is roasted
* Jus will usually settle at the bottom of the pan, leaving a coating called *fond* which is used as the base of pan sauces and gravies

## Freezing Stock

* Two ways to keep your stock frozen are:
  * Pour your stock into an ice cube tray, let it freeze, and move the cubes into a Ziploc freezer bag. This is good for pan sauces, because you don't need that much stock 
  * Keep them in quart-sized freezer bags or plastic containers. This is the ideal way to freeze stock,  because it takes little space and defrosts quickly
