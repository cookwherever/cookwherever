thyme  TIME  1 tablespoon fresh = 3/4 teaspoon dried  Notes:  This herb is widely used in Mediterranean countries to flavor stews and meat sauces.  It's often used in combination with other herbs, like rosemary, parsley, and oregano.  Use dried thyme only in a pinch--fresh thyme is far more flavorful.   omit from recipe ORherbes de Provence (This blend contains thyme.)
