corn tortilla Notes: These thin round wraps are widely used in southern Mexico, and they're the preferred tortilla for making tacos and enchiladas. They should be served hot. If you're watching calories, do this by cooking them on a hot, dry frying pan or by wrapping them in moist paper towels and briefly heating them in a microwave oven. If calories aren't an issue, fry them in oil. You can make corn tortillas at home if you have a tortilla press. Just mix masa harina with enough water to make a bread-like dough, press the dough until it's very thin, and then cook the tortilla in a hot, dry frying pan. Readymade corn tortillas are available in most supermarkets. Substitutes: flour tortilla (more pliable, higher in fat) OR taco shell OR cornmeal cr√®pes made with 1 cup cornmeal + 1/2 teaspoon salt + 1/2 cup flour + 1 egg + 2 cups water OR corn chips
