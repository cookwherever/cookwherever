Kefalotyri = Kefalotiri KEE-fah-loh-TEER-ee Notes: This tangy hard Greek cheese is often grated over dishes. Substitutes: Romano OR Parmesan OR nutritional yeast (This substitution works best if recipe calls for cheese to be sprinkled over a dish. Nutritional yeast is low in fat, high in protein and B vitamins, and it's not made with any animal products.)
