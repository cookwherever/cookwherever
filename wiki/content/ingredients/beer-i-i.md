beer       Most beers are brewed from malted barley and flavored with hops, which makes them slightly bitter.  Beer is good with salty and spicy foods, like pretzels, pizza, and hot dogs, but it can also be used as a cooking ingredient, adding a pleasant bitterness to chili, stews, and soups, and softening the texture of baked goods.  If a recipe calls simply for beer, use a lager beer; a strong ale can easily overpower a dish.  De-alcoholized beers are also available.    stock plus Angostura bitters (in soups or stews) OR fruit juice OR wine
