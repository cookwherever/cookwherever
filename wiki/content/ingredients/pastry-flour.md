pastry flour Look for this in health food stores and specialty shops. Substitutes: equal parts cake flour and all-purpose flour OR 7/8 C all-purpose flour + 2 tablespoons cornstarch OR 7/8 C all-purpose flour (All-purpose flour has more gluten than pastry flour--and gluten makes baked goods tougher. To offset this, handle the dough as little as possible, chill the fat before cutting it into the flour, add the minimal amount of liquid, and consider adding more fat to the recipe.)
