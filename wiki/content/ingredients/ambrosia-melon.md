, casaba melon Notes: These aren't as flavorful as other melons, but they have a fairly long shelf life. Since they have thick rinds, it's useless to smell them as a test for ripeness. Look instead at the color (it should be bright yellow), and then check to see if the blossom end yields to gentle pressure. Substitutes: Santa Claus melon (These also have a long shelf life.) OR Crenshaw melon OR Spanish melon OR Sharlyn melon OR cantaloupe
