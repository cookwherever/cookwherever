boudin blanc = white boudin boo-DAHN BLAHN Notes: This is a white sausage made of meat (pork, chicken, or veal) and rice. France produces a very delicate milk-based version, while the Cajun version includes a lot of rice as a filler, making it chewier and more flavorful. Substitutes: weisswurst OR bratwurst
