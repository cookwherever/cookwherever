sliced almonds   3 ounces = 1 cup You can buy almonds already sliced, or do it yourself using a food processor fitted with a slicing disk.  It's best to toast the sliced almonds before using them.  Just spread them on a baking sheet and put them in a 350� oven until they're light brown, about five to ten minutes.
