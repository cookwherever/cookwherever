oregano = wild marjoram = pot marjoram uh-REG-uh-no Equivalents: 1 tablespoon fresh = 1 teaspoon dried Notes: Oregano is a popular herb in Mediterranean countries, where it's often used to season tomato sauces, meat dishes, and pizzas. Mexican oregano has a mintier taste than ordinary oregano. If you can't find it fresh, dried oregano is a good substitute. Substitutes: marjoram (This is very similar, but milder and sweeter. Substitute two parts of oregano for three parts of marjoram.) OR thyme OR basil OR summer savory
