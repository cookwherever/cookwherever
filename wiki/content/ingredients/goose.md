goose Notes: Europeans traditionally roast these for their Christmas dinners. The meat is dark and fatty, and more like beef than chicken. Young goslings are the priciest, and the most tender. Wild goose is tougher and has a much stronger flavor than a domesticated goose. If the recipe calls for cut-up goose meat, consider using the dark meat from a turkey or chicken. High-fat meats like goose should be cooked at a higher temperature and for a longer time than low-fat meats. Frozen goose is a good substitute for fresh. Substitutes: duck (This is smaller and even fattier than a goose) OR chicken (This is smaller, more tender and less fatty. Cook it at a lower temperature for a shorter time.) OR turkey (This is more tender and less fatty. Cook it at a lower temperature.)
