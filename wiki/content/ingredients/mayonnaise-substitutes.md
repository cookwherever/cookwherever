mayonnaise     See RecipeSource.com postings for Mayonnaise, Homemade Mayonnaise and Eggless Mock Mayonnaise.  Substitutes:  mustard OR roasted garlic (as a sandwich spread) OR aioli OR yogurt (especially in chicken or tuna salads; less rich tasting but lower in calories) OR mashed avocados (This is a good sandwich spread.  Avocados are also high in fat, but it's most monounsaturated fat, which isn't as harmful as other kinds of fat.)
