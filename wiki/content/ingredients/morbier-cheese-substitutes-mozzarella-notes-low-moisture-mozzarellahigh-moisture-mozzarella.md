Morbier cheese   MOR-byay     This creamy and mild cheese has a dark stripe running up the middle, a reference to earlier times when a layer of ash was added to the cheese to protect it from insects.  Morbier has a rich, earthy flavor.  It's a good melting cheese, but you might want to cook with a cheaper cheese like Lappi or Havarti.  Substitutes:  Fontina OR Havarti OR Esrom    mozzarella    mah-tsuh-REHL-uh   Notes:  Mozzarella is one of the few cheeses that doesn't turn rubbery or ooze oil if cooked too long or too hot, so it's a key ingredient in pizzas and casseroles.  It's also stretchy--the long white strings that you often see draped over the sides of pizza boxes are usually mozzarella.  There are two kinds.  Low moisture mozzarella is firmer and the best choice for pizza.  High moisture mozzarella = fresh mozzarella  is more delicate; it's often drizzled with olive oil and serve uncooked as an appetizer.  It works in pizza, too, but you should first put slices of it into a colander to drain for about an hour, and put them on the pizza only during the last minute of cooking.
