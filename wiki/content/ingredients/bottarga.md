bottarga = boutarque = botarega = botargo = salted mullet roe = Sardinian caviar boh-TAR-gah Notes: This Mediterranean specialty is made from the salted and sun-dried roe of either tuna (bottarga di tonno) or mullet (bottarga di muggine). You usually buy it as a sausage and shave off thin slices for hors d'oeuvres or grate it over pasta, fish, or salads. It's expensive but very tasty. Substitutes: tarama OR smoked cod roe
