oil of bitter almonds = almond oil This is a very potent flavoring oil that's sold in small bottles and measured by the drop. Natural bitter almond oil isn't available in the United States since it's slightly toxic, but you can buy a synthetic version in bakers' supply shops or through mail order companies. Don't confuse this with the mildly flavored almond oil that's used in savory dishes. Substitutes: almond extract (Extracts evaporate easily, and therefore can't withstand high heat or prolonged cooking. Four units of extract is roughly equivalent to one unit of flavoring oil, but this may vary according to the products used. Begin by substituting two units of extract per unit of flavoring oil, then add more extract until you're satisfied with the flavor.)
