Chinese almond = apricot seed = hang yen = dried almond These aren't really almonds at all, but apricot kernels. They taste a lot like bitter almonds, and have a rich, heavenly almond-extract fragrance. They're mildly toxic if eaten raw, so they should always be roasted or blanched before using. Look for plastic bags of them in Chinese markets. Substitutes: bitter almonds (These are also mildly toxic if eaten raw, so they aren't available in the United States.) OR oil of bitter almonds (just a few drops) OR almonds plus a few drops of almond extract OR almonds (not as flavorful, more oily)
