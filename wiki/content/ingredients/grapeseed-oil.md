grapeseed oil Notes: This oil is pricey, but it has the highest smoke point of any oil, which makes it ideal for saut�ing or frying over high heat. It's also a good salad oil. Some claim that it reduces the risk of heart disease by reducing LDL (bad cholesterol) levels in the body. Substitutes: avocado oil (also has very high smoke point) OR safflower oil OR sunflower oil OR peanut oil OR corn oil OR soy oil
