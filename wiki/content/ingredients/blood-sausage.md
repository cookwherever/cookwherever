blood sausage = blood pudding = black pudding = black sausage = boudin noir Notes: These eggplant-colored sausages are made of pig's blood mixed with fat, a filler like bread crumbs, and other flavorings that vary from region to region. They're usually sold precooked, but most people heat them before serving. Regional varieties include Germany's blutwurst, Louisiana's boudin rouge, and Spanish morcilla. Substitutes: zungenwurst OR boudin blanc
