Gouda    GOO-duh   Notes:   This Dutch cheese has a mild, nutty flavor.  Varieties include smoked Gouda, the diminutive baby Gouda, and Goudas flavored with garlic and spices.  Goudas are also classed by age.  A young Gouda is mild, an aged Gouda = medium Gouda = mature Gouda is more assertive, and an old Gouda = very aged Gouda is downright pungent.   Edam (similar, but with a lower milkfat content) OR Samsoe OR Bel Paese OR jack OR Muenster  OR  cheese substitutes   Haloumi = Halloumi     hah-LOO-me     This salty, crumbly cheese from Cyprus stands up well to heat and can even be fried or grilled.  Look for it in Middle Eastern markets.   feta (similar flavor) OR mozzarella (similar texture)
