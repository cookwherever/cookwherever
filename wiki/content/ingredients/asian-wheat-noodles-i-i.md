Asian wheat noodles  These are made with wheat flour, salt, water, and sometimes eggs and flavorings.   Always cook wheat noodles in plenty of boiling water.  Some Asian cooks recommend cooking them until they're al dente (cooked through, but still firm), while others suggest cooking them a bit longer to make them softer.  Rinse the noodles in cold water after they're done and let them drain.  Toss them about to prevent them from sticking together, then fry them, or add them to your stir-fry or soup.  Supermarkets often carry several varieties of dried Asian noodles, which can be stored indefinitely.  Asian markets often carry fresh noodles, which can be kept for two or three days in your refrigerator.  pasta (especially ribbons or rods.)
