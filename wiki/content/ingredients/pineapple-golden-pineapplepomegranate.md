pineapple   Pineapples are juicy, mildly acidic, and very versatile.  They can be squeezed for juice, sliced on cakes, skewered and grilled, or eaten raw without adornment.  Select only ripe pineapples; they stop becoming sweeter once they're picked. A new variety, the  golden pineapple, is sweeter, juicier, and richer in vitamin C than ordinary pineapples. A white pineapple also has been developed. Canned pineapple is an acceptable substitute for fresh in many recipes.  papaya (Like a pineapple, it holds its shape when cooked.)     pomegranate = Chinese apple  Cut through the pomegranate's leathery skin, and you'll find hundreds of pretty kernels, each with a tiny seed surrounded by ruby red pulp.  You can eat the kernels, seeds and all, and they're great as garnishes or sprinkled in salads.  You can also press the kernels for juice and strain out the seeds.  Wear an apron when working with pomegranates; the juice can stain your clothes.  They arrive in markets in the late summer and early fall.    grenadine (for the juice)
