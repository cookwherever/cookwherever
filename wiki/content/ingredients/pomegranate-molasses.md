pomegranate molasses = concentrated pomegranate juice This tart Middle Eastern syrup became trendy a few years ago when Western cooks discovered that it adds zing to meat glazes, sauces, and soups. It also makes a wonderful topping for ice cream, and it can be mixed with soda water to make a tasty non-alcoholic drink. Look for bottles of it in Middle Eastern markets or gourmet stores. Store it in the refrigerator, where it will keep almost indefinitely. Don't confuse pomegranate molasses with grenadine, which is much sweeter. Substitutes: cranberry juice concentrate OR pomegranate juice OR balsamic vinegar OR verjus (Like pomegranate molasses, this makes a delicious non-alcoholic drink when mixed with soda water.) OR creme de cassis (in mixed drinks) OR grenadine (This is much sweeter than pomegranate molasses.)
