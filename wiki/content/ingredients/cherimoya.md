cherimoya = custard apple = sherbet fruit = chirimolla = chirimoya = (incorrectly) pawpaw Pronunciation: chair-uh-MOY-yuh Notes: This South American tropical fruit is shaped like a pine cone and has a gray-green, scaly skin. The soft white pulp inside has large black (inedible) seeds and tastes like a creamy blend of tropical flavors. Hard cherimoyas should be stored at room temperature until they give a little when squeezed, then they should be refrigerated until they're ready to serve. Substitutes: atemoya OR sweetsop OR soursop (larger) OR llama OR combine equal parts strawberries, bananas, and pineapple
