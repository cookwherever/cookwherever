konbu = kombu = tangle = sea tangle = oarweed = sea cabbage = kelp KOM-boo Notes: Like other sea vegetables, konbu is rich in minerals. It's very popular in Japan, where it's used to flavor dashi, a soup stock. Konbu is usually sold dried, in strips or sheets. Choose konbu that's very dark, almost black, and don't wipe off the white residue that often appears on the surface; it's very flavorful. Substitutes: monosodium glutamate (as a flavor-booster; use just a dash)
