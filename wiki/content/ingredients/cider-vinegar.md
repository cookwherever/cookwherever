cider vinegar = apple cider vinegar Notes: Made from fermented apples, this fruity vinegar is inexpensive and tangy. While it's not the best choice for vinaigrettes or delicate sauces, it works well in chutneys, hearty stews, and marinades. It's also used to make pickles, though it will darken light-colored fruits and vegetables. Substitutes: malt vinegar OR white vinegar (a good choice for pickles) OR wine vinegar (not for pickles)
