Gamay = Gamay Noir This is a grape variety that the French use to make their famous Beaujolais wine, a fruity, fresh-tasting red wine. Wines made from these grapes outside of the Beaujolais region are simply called Gamay. Don't confuse this wine with Gamay Beaujolais, which is made from a blend of Pinot Noir and Valdiguie grapes, or with Napa Gamay, another name for Valdiguie. Substitutes: Beaujolais OR Pinot Noir
