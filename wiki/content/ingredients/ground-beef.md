ground beef = hamburger = mince beef This varies in quality depending upon what part of the carcass the meat came from. Ground chuck has a high fat content, which means it makes the juiciest hamburgers and meatloaf. Ground round is very lean, and a good choice if you're trying to reduce the fat in your diet. Ground sirloin is also lean, but it's more flavorful (and more expensive) than ground round. Substitutes: ground chicken OR ground turkey OR ground lamb OR portobello mushrooms (These are great for grilling; don't wash or marinate, just brush with oil while they're on the grill.) OR TVP
