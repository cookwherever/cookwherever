whipped cream    Beat chilled heavy cream in a chilled narrow bowl with chilled beaters until the cream forms soft peaks.  To sweeten, add two tablespoons of powdered sugar.  One cup heavy cream yields two cups whipped cream.  To make Chantilly cream = cr�me Chantilly, beat one cup chilled whipping cream until thick, add two tablespoons powdered sugar plus 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, then continue beating until peaks form.
