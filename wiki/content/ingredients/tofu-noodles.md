tofu noodles = soybean curd noodles = tofu shreds = gan si = beancurd noodles = bean curd noodles = soy noodles = soy vermicelli These chewy noodles look like a pack of rubber bands, but they're made from compressed tofu and packed with protein and nutrients. They're usually served in salads, soups, or stir-fries. Look for them in the refrigerated or frozen foods section of Asian markets. Dried tofu noodles are also available; before using, soak them in water mixed with baking soda until they soften, then rinse. Don't confuse these with bean curd skin noodles, which are darker and chewier. Substitutes: tofu (cut into small cubes)
