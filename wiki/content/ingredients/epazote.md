epazote = goosefoot = Jerusalem oak = lamb's quarters = Mexican tea = wormseed = stinkweed Pronunciation: eh-pa-ZOH-teh Notes: This strongly-flavored herb is commonly used in Mexican bean dishes, partly because it's supposed to reduce flatulence. Fresh epazote has dark green leaves with serrated edges. If you can't find it, the dried version is an acceptable substitute. Substitutes: savory (Like epazote, savory pairs well with beans.) OR omit it from the recipe OR ajwain seeds OR parsley (not as bitter) OR cilantro (not as bitter)
