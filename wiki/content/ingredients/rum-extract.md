rum extract This is used to impart the flavor of rum without the alcohol. Though rum extracts are made with alcohol, such a small amount is needed in any recipe that the end product is virtually non-alcoholic. If you're a stickler, though, non-alcoholic rum extracts are also available, as are Passover rum extracts. Substitutes: rum (1 teaspoon rum extract = 3 tablespoons rum) OR orange extract (use less)
