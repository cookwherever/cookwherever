Chinese eggplant Compared to the familiar American eggplant, Chinese eggplants have thinner skins, a more delicate flavor, and not as many of the seeds that tend to make eggplants bitter. Substitutes: Japanese eggplant (This is similar, but it tends to be a bit more bitter than the Chinese eggplant.) OR small Italian eggplant
