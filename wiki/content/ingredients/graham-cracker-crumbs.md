graham cracker crumbs Equivalents: 14 crackers = 1 cup crumbs. Notes: These mildly sweet crumbs make a terrific cheesecake or pie crust. Look for the crumbs in baking supplies section, or buy whole graham crackers and crush them yourself. Many markets also carry readymade graham cracker pie crusts. Substitutes: Vanilla wafer crumbs (These are sweeter, so add a bit less sugar to the crust mixture.) OR chopped nuts (1 cup graham cracker crumbs + 1 cup sugar = 1 1/2 cup chopped nuts + 1/8 cup sugar) OR chocolate wafer crumbs OR zwieback crumbs (works well in cheesecakes)
