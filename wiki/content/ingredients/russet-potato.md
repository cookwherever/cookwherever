russet potato = Idaho potato = baking potato = starchy potato = chef's potato These potatoes are high in starch and low in moisture, so they bake well and yield light, fluffy mashed potatoes. They don't hold their shape after cooking, so don't use them to make potato salads or scalloped potatoes. Don't wrap them in aluminum foil while baking them; the foil traps moisture and makes the potato mushier. Substitutes: white rose potato (for fries) OR Yukon gold potatoes (for mashing)
