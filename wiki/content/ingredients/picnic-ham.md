picnic ham = picnic shoulder = pork shoulder picnic ham This is cured like a ham, but cut from the hog's shoulder. It's not as tender and lean as a true ham, and it cooks much quicker. It's a good, inexpensive choice if you want chopped ham for soups and casseroles. Substitutes: city ham OR Boston butt
