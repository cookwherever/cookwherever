lime These tart green fruits are similar to lemons, but they're more acidic and have their own unique flavor. Varieties include the common Persian lime = Tahiti lime and the smaller, less juicy, and more acidic Florida key lime = key lime = Mexican lime. When buying limes, select specimens that are dark green, smaller, thin-skinned, and heavy for their size. Equivalents: 1 lime yields about 2 tablespoons lime juice Substitutes: lemon (Lemons have a weaker flavor and are less acidic, so use a bit more to compensate.) OR kalamansi limequat Notes: This is a cross between a lime and a kumquat. It's similar in size and shape to a kumquat, but with a green or yellow-green skin. It has a strong lime flavor. Substitutes: kumquats (very similar in appearance, different flavor)
