laksa noodles These rice noodles look like white spaghetti. They're used to make laksa, a noodle dish popular in Indonesia and Malaysia. Don't confuse the noodles with laksa leaves, a kind of mint that's often used to season the noodles. Substitutes: rice sticks OR bean threads OR Chinese wheat noodles (as thin as possible)
