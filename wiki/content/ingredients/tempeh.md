tempeh = tempe TEM-pay OR tem-PAY Notes: This Indonesian meat substitute is made from soybeans and other grains that have been injected with a mold and allowed to ferment. It's rich in protein and fiber and has a chewy texture and salty, nutty flavor. Before using it, steam or simmer it for about twenty minutes. Then use it just like tofu or meat--either by marinating it and grilling or by crumbling it into pieces and frying them.
