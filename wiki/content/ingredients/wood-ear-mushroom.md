wood ear mushroom = woodear mushroom = black fungus = tree ear mushroom Notes: Chinese markets carry fresh or dried pieces of this tree mushroom. You're supposed to soak or simmer the dried chips until they soften, and then rinse them carefully to remove any dirt. They're not very flavorful, but they have an interesting texture and are believed to have medicinal benefits. Substitutes: cloud ear mushroom (thinner) OR silver ear (more expensive) OR shiitake
