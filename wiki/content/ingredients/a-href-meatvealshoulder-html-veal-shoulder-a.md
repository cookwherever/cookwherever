veal shoulder   The cuts here are more economical, since the meat is tougher and often interlaced with bone and connective tissue.  Butchers usually bone, roll, and tie the shoulder to make a rolled roast, but they sometimes also cut the shoulder into smaller roasts and steaks.veal ribs  The ribs are usually cut into chops, but you can also roast the entire rack of veal, or tie two or three racks together to form a crown roast of veal.veal loin  The most buttery cuts of all come from the loin, but you'll pay dearly for them.  veal leg  The choice meat in the leg is often sliced into thin cutlets to be used for veal scaloppini, schnitzels, and escalopes.   You can also buy larger cuts for roasting or braising.veal breast  The breast includes the lower end of the ribs, along with some fairly lean meat.veal miscellaneous cuts  This category includes cuts taken from different parts of the carcass, including ground veal, stew meat, and the shank.
