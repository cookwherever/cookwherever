yogurt = yoghurt This is milk that's cultured with bacteria to make it thick and tangy. Ready-made yogurts are made from whole milk (with up to 4% butterfat), lowfat milk (with up to 2% butterfat), and skim milk (with up to .5% butterfat). Health buffs prefer brands that contain active cultures, which help keep their intestines populated with friendly bacteria. Many brands are heat-treated to destroy these cultures and increase shelf life. Yogurt often comes with added flavorings and thickeners. "Light" flavored yogurts are made with artificial sweeteners to reduce calories. Lactaid makes a lactose-reduced yogurt, but many people with lactose intolerance can tolerate ordinary yogurt, especially brands that contains active yogurt cultures. Larger markets also carry yogurt made from soy milk and goat's milk, but these don't work well in delicate desserts. Organic yogurts also are available. To make your own: Add a tablespoon of plain yogurt (with active cultures) to milk and keep it at roughly 110Â° for several hours, then refrigerate. Where to find it: Dairy case of most markets Substitutes: sour cream (This is higher in fat and calories, but less likely to curdle if boiled with an acidic ingredient.) OR buttermilk (This substitution usually works well in baked goods, dressings, and sauces.) OR blend cottage cheese until smooth (not as tart) OR silky tofu (not as tart; doesn't work well in delicate desserts)
