feijoa = feijoda = pineapple guava     feh-JO-uh    To eat feijoas, just cut them in half and scoop out the pulp with a spoon.  They also make terrific preserves and syrups.  Look for them in large supermarkets.  If they're hard when you buy them, allow them to ripen at room temperature until they give a bit when you squeeze them, then store them in the refrigerator.  Substitutes:  kiwi fruit OR pineapple OR strawberries OR guava
