calypso bean = yin yang bean = orca bean 1 cup dried beans yields 3 cups cooked beans Notes: Cooking these beautiful beans in lots of water helps keep them from losing their distinctive coloring. Substitutes: cannellini beans (These are all white, and they take longer to cook than calypso beans.) OR black bean (These have a stronger flavor than calypso beans.)
