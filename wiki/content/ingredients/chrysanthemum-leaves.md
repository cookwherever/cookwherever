chrysanthemum leaves = chop suey greens = tong ho = tung ho = garland chrysanthemum = shungiku Notes: This Asian potherb is used to flavor salads, soups, sukiyaki and other dishes. The leaves are usually blanched briefly to soften them and deepen their color, but young leaves can be served raw. Add them to cooked dishes at the last minute, as they become bitter if overcooked. Substitutes: spinach
