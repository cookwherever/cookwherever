truffle oil Notes: This is a secret ingredient of many chefs, who use it to impart the earthy taste and aroma of truffles to their dishes. There are two varieties: the mild white truffle oil and the more pungent black truffle oil. Both are delicious sprinkled on pasta, but the black truffle oil is better suited to meats and heavy sauces while the white is the best choice for fish dishes, cream sauces, and vinaigrettes. If you're cooking with it, add it at the very end to prevent the flavor from dissipating. Truffle oil is expensive, but a little goes a long way. To make your own: Finely chop a very dry, fresh truffle, and place in a clean jar with enough olive oil to completely fill it. Allow the truffle to steep for a few days, then store the jar in the refrigerator. Substitutes: truffles OR truffles preserved in brandy
