semi-sweet chocolate = semisweet chocolate  One cup of chips = 6 ounces; if melting the chocolate, chips and squares are interchangeable.  Squares can be chopped up to make chips for cookies.     Americans like this best for their cookies and brownies.   It's available in bars, chunks, and chips.  Mint-flavored semi-sweet chips are also available.      bittersweet chocolate (very similar, but bittersweet chocolate usually has more chocolate liquor.) OR unsweetened chocolate (1 ounce = 1 ounce unsweetened chocolate + 1 tablespoon sugar) OR 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa + 1 tablespoon sugar + 1 teaspoon unsalted butter or vegetable oil (may leave a powdery taste, but makes product moister and more flavorful.) OR 1 tablespoon peanut butter chips OR white chocolate (especially in chocolate chip cookies; more delicate flavor, burns more easily, contains more sugar.) OR milk chocolate
