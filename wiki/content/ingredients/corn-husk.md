corn husk = hoja de ma�z Hispanic cooks use these, both fresh and dried, to wrap tamales before steaming them. Before using, soak the husks in hot water for about 30 minutes to make them more pliable. Substitutes: banana leaves (for wrapping food) OR aluminum foil (for wrapping food) OR hoja santa leaves (imparts an interesting root beer-like flavor),
