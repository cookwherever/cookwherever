cherimoya = custard apple = sherbet fruit = chirimolla = chirimoya = (incorrectly) pawpaw Pronunciation: chair-uh-MOY-yuh Notes: This South American tropical fruit is shaped like a pine cone and has a gray-green, scaly skin. The soft white pulp inside has large black (inedible) seeds and tastes like a creamy blend of tropical flavors. Hard cherimoyas should be stored at room temperature until they give a little when squeezed, then they should be refrigerated until they're ready to serve. Substitutes: atemoya OR sweetsop OR soursop (larger) OR llama OR combine equal parts strawberries, bananas, and pineapple Chinese date (fresh) = jujube (fresh) These are usually dried, but you can sometimes find fresh dates in late summer and fall. When you get them home, let them ripen on the counter for awhile until they become soft and sweet. Substitutes: apples OR prunes
