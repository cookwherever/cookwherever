### Tips
* Recipes that call for pasta usually intend for you to use dried pasta, since sauces cling to it better.
* The best dried pasta is made from 100% durum wheat semolina, and has a rough surface, the better to absorb sauces.
* Fresh pasta absorbs flavors and works best with cream or cheese sauces. It cooks faster than dried pasta.
* Use lots of water when cooking pasta, at least a gallon per pound. You can add salt to the water if you wish, but don't add oil. Bring the water to a rolling boil before adding the pasta. When the water returns to a boil, lower the heat to maintain a low boil. Stir occasionally to keep the pasta from sticking together. Don't cover the pot.
* Pasta is ready when it's "al dente." It should be cooked completely through, yet firm enough to offer some resistance to your bite.
* Drain the pasta in a colander, but don't rinse it unless you plan to use it in a casserole or pasta salad. Reserve a small amount of the flavorful cooking liquid in case the pasta becomes too dry and needs to be moistened. Serve it as soon as possible.
* For pasta salads, select short, thick tubes or shapes of dried pasta for pasta salad. Don't use egg pasta or fresh pasta.
* For casseroles, select tubes with thick walls or sturdy shapes. Cook them for two-thirds of the recommended time in water, then let them finish cooking in the oven.
* Different kinds of pasta cook at different rates, so select shapes of similar sizes if you're combining them.
* If you use a low-quality pasta, be sure to cook it in plenty of water to prevent it from getting gummy.
* Don't freeze cooked pasta unless it's in a baked casserole.
* Many pasta shapes comes in different sizes. The Italian suffix "ini" means smaller (e.g., spaghettini is a thin version of spaghetti), while "oni" means larger.
