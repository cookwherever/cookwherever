suey gow wrappers = soi gow skins These are similar to potsticker wrappers, but they're intended to be used in soups. While assembling the dumplings, keep the stack of wrappers moist by covering them with a damp towel. Seal the dumplings with a "glue" made with cornstarch and water. Look for stacks of these wrappers in the refrigerator cases of Asian markets. Store them in the refrigerator or freezer, but let them come to room temperature before using. Substitutes: potsticker wrappers OR dumpling wrappers (thinner) OR wonton wrappers (thinner) OR eggroll wrappers (cut these down to size) OR pasta sheet
