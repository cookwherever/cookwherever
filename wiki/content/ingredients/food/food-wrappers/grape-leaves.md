grape leaves = vine leaves = grape vine leaves Greeks stuff these with ground lamb and rice to make dolmades, but they're used elsewhere to make pickles and beds for food. They're hard to find fresh in markets, but you can often find them in cans or jars. Trim the stems and rinse off the brine before using. To make your own: Plunge grape leaves (that haven't been sprayed with harmful chemicals) for one minute in boiling, salted water (2 teaspoons pickling salt per quart), then drain. Substitutes: green cabbage (use the leaves as wrappers) OR bell pepper (Hollow out the pepper and stuff it with filling.) OR lettuce (as a bed for food) OR mustard greens OR Swiss chard
