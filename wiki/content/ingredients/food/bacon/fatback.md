fatback This is a slab of fat that runs along the back of a pig. You can render it into lard, cut it into barding strips to wrap around lean roasts, or use it to line terrine or p�t� pans. It you're cutting it into sheets, it helps to put it in the freezer first until it's firm. It's also sometimes cured like bacon. It's hard to find, ask your butcher. Substitutes: caul fat (great for making terrines or p�t�s, but hard to find) OR bacon (blanch before using; good for barding or lining terrine pans) OR salt pork (blanch first)
