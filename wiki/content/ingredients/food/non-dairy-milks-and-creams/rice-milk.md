rice milk Look for this in aseptic containers. Some varieties are gluten-free; others are not. A common brand is Rice Dream. To make your own: See the recipe for Rice Milk posted on www.vegweb.com. Substitutes: almond milk (Like rice milk, this works well in most desserts.) OR horchata OR cow's milk (less expensive and more nutritious, but its production involves the exploitation of animals) OR goat's milk (less expensive, more nutritious, exploits animals) OR oat milk (more versatile that rice milk; works well in both sweet and savory dishes) OR soy milk (best used in baked goods; doesn't work well in many savory dishes) Cooking notes: Shake well before using!
