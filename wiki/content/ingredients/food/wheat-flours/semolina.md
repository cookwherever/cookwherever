semolina durum wheat flour (also good for pastas, inferior color) OR kamut flour (This makes a decent pasta and can be tolerated by most people with wheat allergies) OR spelt flour (Like kamut flour, this makes a good pasta and is tolerated by most people with wheat allergies.) OR all-purpose flour (Pasta made entirely of this is less firm than that made with semolina. To keep it from getting mushy, cook the pasta in plenty of water and eat it immediately after it's cooked.)
