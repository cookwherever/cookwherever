whole wheat flour = wholemeal flour (Britain) Includes: regular and stone-ground whole wheat flour (better flavor, coarser texture, similar nutrients) Substitutes: graham flour (more nutrients) OR all-purpose flour (makes lighter, larger loaves of bread) OR (in yeast breads) up to 1/4 C gluten flour (this improves the bread's texture) To see how to substitute other flours for wheat flours when making yeast breads, see the listing under all-purpose flour.
