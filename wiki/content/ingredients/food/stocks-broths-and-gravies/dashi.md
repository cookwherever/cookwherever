dashi DAH-shee Notes: This is a very common Japanese soup stock, usually made with bonito flakes and kelp. Variations include katsuo dashi (made without kelp), konbu dashi (made without bonito flakes), niboshi dashi and iriko dashi (made with different kinds of fish; more flavorful than ordinary dashi), and koi dashi (made with vegetables). Dash-no-moto is an instant version. To make your own: Add a piece of dried konbu and some dried bonito flakes to water, simmer. Substitutes: reconstituted dashi powder (sold as hon dashi or Dashi-No-Moto) OR chicken broth (not as flavorful)
