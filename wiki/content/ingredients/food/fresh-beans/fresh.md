fresh fava bean = fresh broad bean = fresh butter bean = fresh Windsor bean = fresh horse bean = fresh English bean Pronunciation: FAH-vah Notes: Tender fresh fava beans are available in the fall and are much better tasting than canned, dried, or frozen ones. Fresh young fava beans need only be shelled, but more mature beans should also be peeled to rid them of their tough, waxy skins. Substitutes: fava bean (dried) OR fresh lima beans (These are sweeter, and more delicately flavored.) OR chickpeas
