Picholine olive Picholines are green, torpedo-shaped olives that are brine-cured. Those made in Provence are marinated with coriander and herbes de Provence, while American picholines are soaked in citric acid. They're great martini olives. Substitutes: green olives OR caper berries (as a garnish for martinis) OR cocktail onions (This turns a martini into a Gibson.)
