arm roast = arm pot roast = arm chuck roast = chuck arm roast = round bone pot roast = round bone roast Notes: This is just a butcher's blade away from the shoulder roast, and the main difference between the two is that the arm roast has a round bone in it and is slightly more tender. You can use this for a pot roast, or cut it up for stew meat, but it's too tough to cook with dry heat. A steak cut from this roast is called an arm steak. Substitutes: shoulder roast OR bottom round OR cross rib roast
