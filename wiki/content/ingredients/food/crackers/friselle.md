friselle free-ZEHL-eh Notes: These peppery Italian crackers are baked twice, which makes them hard and dry and gives them a long shelf life. They're usually rehydrated with water and then topped with olive oil and other flavorings like herbs, cheese, and tomatoes. Substitutes: focaccia OR zwieback OR croutons
