butter This is a delicious solid fat churned from milk. It's used in baking, frying, and as a spread on toast and muffins. Recipes that call for butter in most better cookbooks are referring to unsalted butter = sweet cream butter = sweet butter. Salted butter doesn't spoil as readily (the salt serves as a preservative). See also the entries for whipped butter and European-style butter. Equivalents: 1 pound = 2 cups = 4 sticks. 1 stick = 8 tablespoons. 1 stick salted butter = 1 stick unsalted butter + 3/8 teaspoon salt. (The salt content of salted butter can vary between brands.) To make your own: In a blender or food processor, mix one cup chilled whipping cream for a few minutes until butter forms. Pour off excess liquid (buttermilk) and wash butter repeatedly with cold water until rinse water is clear. Substitutions: margarine (This has an inferior flavor, makes bread crusts tougher and cookies softer, and may make cookies more difficult to shape. Avoid using it in flaky pastries.) OR shortening (This has an inferior flavor, and compared to butter it makes cookies crunchier and breads crusts softer. OR lard (This has an inferior flavor, but it makes flakier pastries than butter. Some cooks mix lard with butter to strike a balance between flavor and flakiness. Substitute four parts lard for every five parts butter called for in recipe.) See also: fat (for low-fat or no-fat substitutions)
