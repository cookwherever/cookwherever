clarified butter = drawn butter = AMF = anhydrous milkfat = butter oil = ghee This is butter without the milk solids, so it doesn't go rancid or smoke when heated to a high temperature. Look for jars of it in Indian markets. To make your own: Melt butter using very low heat until a white deposit forms on the bottom of the pan, then strain and discard milky residue. It's best to refrigerate this in case some of the milk solids remain. Substitutes: canola oil (more healthful) OR other vegetable oil (Not as flavorful, but the fat is unsaturated.) OR butter (downside: foods fried in unclarified butter are more likely to overbrown) OR cooking spray (for greasing pans)
