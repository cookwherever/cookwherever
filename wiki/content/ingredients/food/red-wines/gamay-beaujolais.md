Gamay Beaujolais This name is given to American red wines made mostly from Pinot Noir and Valdiguie grapes. It's an unexceptional fruity wine that goes best with hearty dishes that have rich sauces. Don't confuse this wine with Gamay or Napa Gamay, both of which are superior. The name Gamay Beaujolais is scheduled to be phased out by 2007. Substitutes: Valdiguie OR Pinot Noir OR Beaujolais OR Cabernet Sauvignon OR Burgundy OR Syrah
