black-eyed pea = cowpea = crowder pea = lobhia = lombia = black-eye bean = black-eye pea = black-eyed suzy = China bean = chawli = poor man's pea = Southern pea Notes: Originally from China, these chewy peas were common fare on slave plantations. They're still popular in the South, where they're traditionally eaten on New Year's Day or combined with rice and sausage to make Hoppin' John. They don't need soaking and cook fairly quickly. Don't overcook them, or they'll get mushy. Substitutes: black-eyed pea, fresh OR yellow-eyed peas ("eye" is yellow, not black) OR pigeon peas OR split peas OR lentils
