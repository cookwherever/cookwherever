The outer leaves are green and somewhat bitter; the pale inner leaves are more tender and mild. Don't confuse this with Belgian endive, which the British call chicory and the French call endive. Substitutes: escarole (milder flavor, different texture) OR radicchio OR dandelion greens OR mustard greens dandelions = dandelion greens Dandelions have a somewhat bitter flavor, which Europeans appreciate more than Americans.
