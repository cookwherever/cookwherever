bamboo shoots = takenoko = take-noko = tung sun = choke-sun = chun-sun You can buy fresh shoots at some Chinese markets, but you must boil them first to rid them of hydrocyanic acid, a toxin that causes cyanide poisoning. Canned shoots are safer and more widely available. Rinse them well before using. Submerge any unused shoots in fresh water and store them in a sealed container in the refrigerator, changing the water daily. Substitutes: asparagus OR coconut shoots (sweeter)
