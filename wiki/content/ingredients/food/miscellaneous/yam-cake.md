yam cake = konnyaku = ita konnyaku These bland gelatinous cakes are made from devil's root. They're popular in Japan since they're low in calories, and eating them helps suppress the appetite. Look for black or white yam cakes at Japanese markets. Substitutes: shirataki (Same thing, only in the form of noodles.)
