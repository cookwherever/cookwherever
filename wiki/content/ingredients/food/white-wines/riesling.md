Riesling REEZ-ling Notes: If made in Germany or Alsace, a Riesling is a very good, somewhat sweet white wine. If made in America, it's usually a so-so white wine that's usually made from Sylvaner = Franken Riesling, Gray Riesling and Emerald Riesling grapes, mediocre varieties which coast on the reputation of their superior relative, Johanissberg Riesling. Substitutes: Johanissberg Riesling OR Gew�rztraminer OR Pinot Blanc OR Chenin blanc OR Pinot blanc OR 1C Riesling = 1/2 C white wine + 1/2 C water + 1/3 C sugar
