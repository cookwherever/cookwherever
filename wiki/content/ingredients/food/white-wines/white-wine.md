white wine White wines are more delicate than red wines and are always served chilled. Dry (i.e., not sweet) white wines include Chardonnay, Chablis, and Sauvignon Blanc. These are normally served with fish, poultry, veal, blue cheeses, and anything with a cream sauce. Sweeter white wines are often described as "fruity" and include Gew�rztraminer, Johannisberg Riesling, and Chenin Blanc. These are good with spicy foods, fruit, and desserts. Substitutes: dry vermouth OR blush wine OR sake OR sparkling wine OR sherry OR mirin OR white grape juice OR apple juice OR apple cider OR chicken broth plus lemon juice OR clam juice (in seafood recipes) OR water
