candlenut = candle nut = kemiri = country walnut = buah keras Notes: Candlenuts must be cooked before eating, since they're highly toxic when raw. Ground candlenuts are often used to thicken Malaysian and Indonesian curries. They're so oily that natives string them together and use them as candles. Look for them in Southeast Asian markets. Substitutes: macadamia nuts (a close substitute) OR Brazil nuts (These are three times as large as candlenuts, so use fewer.) OR raw cashews ( Substitute two cashews for every candlenut.) OR blanched almonds ( Substitute two almonds for every candlenut.)
