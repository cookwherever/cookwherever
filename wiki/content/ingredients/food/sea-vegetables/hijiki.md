hijiki = hiziki Hijiki has a mild flavor, so it's a good choice if you want to slip a sea vegetable unobtrusively into your soups and stews in order to fortify them with calcium, iron, and other nutrients. When rehydrated, it roughly quadruples in size, so a little goes a long way. Substitutes: arame (This is milder than hijiki, and it doesn't expand as much when rehydrated.) OR dulse
