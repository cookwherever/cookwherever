quince = golden apple This pleasantly tart fruit needs to be cooked before eating. Quinces are high in pectin, so they're commonly used to make jams and jellies. Some cooks simply bake them like apples. They come into season from August to December. Substitutes: Asian pears (Like quince, these hold their shape when cooked for long periods.) OR crab apples OR Granny Smith apples OR pippin apples OR Rhode Island Greening apples
