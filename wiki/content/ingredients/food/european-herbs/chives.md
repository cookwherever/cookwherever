chives Notes: These slender, hollow shoots have a mild onion flavor. Many cooks use scissors to cut fresh chives, sprinkling them like confetti on potatoes, eggs, and salads. Always use fresh chives--they lose much of their flavor when they're frozen or freeze-dried. Substitutes: green onion tops (These have a stronger flavor and wider shoots. If using them as a substitute for minced chives, slice them lengthwise several times before mincing.) OR Chinese chives (more flavorful)
