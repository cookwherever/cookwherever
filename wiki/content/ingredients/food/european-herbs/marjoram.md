marjoram = sweet marjoram = knot marjoram = knotted marjoram MAR-jer-um Notes: Marjoram is sweeter and milder than its close relative, oregano. It's often used to season meats and fish, and works best when its added near the end of the cooking period. Fresh is best, but frozen or dried marjoram are acceptable substitutes. Don't confuse this with wild marjoram, which is better known as oregano. Equivalents: 1 tablespoon fresh = 1 teaspoon dried. Substitutes: oregano (This is very similar, but not as sweet and mild as marjoram. Substitute two parts of oregano for three parts of marjoram.) OR thyme OR sage OR basil OR summer savory
