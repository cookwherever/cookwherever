whipped cream To make your own: Beat chilled heavy cream in a chilled narrow bowl with chilled beaters until the cream forms soft peaks. To sweeten, add two tablespoons of powdered sugar. One cup heavy cream yields two cups whipped cream. To make Chantilly cream = crï¿½me Chantilly, beat one cup chilled whipping cream until thick, add two tablespoons powdered sugar plus 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, then continue beating until peaks form. Substitutes: With chilled beaters and a chilled bowl, whip 12 ounces of very well-chilled evaporated milk and serve immediately. If you wish, add up to 2 tablespoons chilled lemon juice to milk before beating. (This substitute doesn't taste as rich, but is lower in fat and calories.) OR pressurized whipped cream topping (more convenient, but it's more expensive and doesn't taste as good) OR frozen yogurt (lower in fat) OR well-drained vanilla yogurt (lower in fat) OR (as topping for hot chocolate) marshmallows (lower in fat) OR nondairy whipped cream substitute (Check the labels. A popular brand of this is very high in saturated fat.) Links: See the Recipesource.com posting for Mock Whipped Cream.
