Chenin blanc = White Pinot Notes: This is a grape variety that's often blended with others to make inexpensive white jug wines and domestic Chablis. It's relatively inexpensive and goes well with salads, seafood, poultry, ham, and spicy foods. Substitutes: Pinot blanc OR Chablis (Domestic Chablis wines are often made partly from Chenin Blanc grapes.) OR vermouth (Use this substitute for cooking, not drinking. Use dry vermouth only.)
