acorn  These nuts come from oak trees, and they were once an important food for Native Americans.   Before they can be eaten, most acorns need to be treated to remove the bitter tannins in them.   To do this, boil whole shelled acorns in water, replacing the water with fresh boiling water whenever it turns light brown. Keep doing this for about two hours, until the water no longer changes color.   Alternatively, you can soak the shelled acorns in several changes of water for three or four days.  Some Native Americans do this by putting whole or pounded acorns into nylon stockings and hanging them so that they're immersed in the water of a toilet tank (repeat:  tank, not bowl).  Each time the toilet is flushed, the water in the tank is refreshed.  This may discolor the toilet, however.  After the nuts have been leached of tannins, roast them in a 350� oven for about an hour.  They can then be eaten whole or ground into acorn meal and used to make porridges or breads.  Acorns from white oaks aren't nearly as bitter as those from red or black oaks, and can be roasted without first soaking them.   hazelnuts (These are like acorns, only they're low in tannin.)
