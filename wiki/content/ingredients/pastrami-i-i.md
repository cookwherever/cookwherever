pastrami  This is beef brisket that's been seasoned and dry-cured.  It's often served hot on rye bread.  corned beef (not as tender, but very similar) p�t� = pate = pat� = liver paste   pah-TAY Notes:   Leave it to the French to come up with this buttery rich delicacy.  Goose p�t� is pricier and more subtle than duck p�t�, and is the best choice if you plan to serve the p�t� cold.  Duck p�t� works best in warm dishes.  Some people refuse to eat p�t� de foie gras from France because the animals are force-fed to enlarge their livers. Substitutes:  liverwurst OR foie gras entier OR monkfish liver
