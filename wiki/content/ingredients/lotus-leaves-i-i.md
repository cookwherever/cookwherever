lotus leaves  These leaves open up like butterfly wings, each about two feet high.  They're often wrapped around rice and other fillings, to which they impart an earthy aroma when the bundles are steamed.  The leaves are available either fresh or, more commonly, dried in Asian markets.  Soak them for at least an hour in warm water before using, and keep fresh leaves in a cool, dry place or else freeze them.  Substitutes:  banana leaves OR parchment paper brushed with oil (for wrapping food)
