pomelo = pummelo = Chinese grapefruit = shaddock PUHM-uh-low Notes: This has a very thick peel, so you have to work hard to eat it. Many people think it's worth the trouble, for the pulp is milder and sweeter than its closest substitute, the grapefruit. Substitutes: grapefruit (more acidic and more bitter)
