French bread  This is the traditional French bread that has a hard, dark brown crust and many large air pockets.  The baguette = baguet  (bah-GET) is the standard tube-shaped French bread, about two feet long.  The bâtarde = batarde    (buh-TARD) is a bit larger than a baguette, while the baton (bah-TOH), is a bit smaller, and the ficelle (fee-SELL) is much narrower.     Italian bread  (Usually shorter and rounder than French bread.) Greek bread
