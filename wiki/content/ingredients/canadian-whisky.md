Canadian whisky These blended whiskies have a lighter body than those made in the United States. Crown Royal and Canadian Club are popular brands. Canadians follow the British convention of spelling whisky without an "e." Whiskey should be served at room temperature. Substitutes: Irish whiskey OR Scotch (not as light) OR blended whiskey OR 1 part vanilla extract + 2 parts water OR sherry
