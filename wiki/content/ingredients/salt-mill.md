salt mill Trendy cooks fill this gadget with expensive sea salt crystals so that they season their food with freshly ground salt. It's not clear why they do this, since salt is an inorganic mineral and, unlike pepper and other spices, doesn't become stale once ground. Substitutes: mortar and pestle OR place salt in a plastic bag, seal, then crush the salt with a rolling pin.
