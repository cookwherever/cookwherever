parsley      Notes:   Parsley is prized both for its looks and for its fresh, grassy flavor.  There are two common varieties:  the mild curly parsley and the more flavorful Italian parsley.  Use curly parsley if you want looks and Italian parsley if you want flavor.  Parsley doesn't hold up well to cooking, so add it to cooked dishes at the very last minute.  Frozen parsley is a good substitute for fresh, but dried parsley adds only color.  chervil OR celery tops OR cilantro
