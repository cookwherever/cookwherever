sweet dumpling squash Sweet dumpling squash are fairly small, so you can cut them in half, bake them, and serve each half as an individual portion. The flesh is sweeter and drier than that of other winter squash, and the peel is soft enough to be eaten. Substitutes: butternut squash OR kabocha squash OR acorn squash
