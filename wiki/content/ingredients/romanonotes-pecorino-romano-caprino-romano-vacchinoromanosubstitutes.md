Romano   Notes:   Romano is similar to Parmesan and Asiago, only it has a nuttier, sharper, and saltier flavor.  It's often grated onto pizzas and pasta dishes to add flavor.  Pecorino Romano is made from sheep's milk, Caprino Romano from goat's milk, and  Vacchino Romano from cow's milk.  Domestic Romanos aren't as well-regarded as Italian Romanos.  Substitutes:  Parmesan (not as sharp and salty) OR Asiago (sweeter) OR Sapsago (low-fat) OR Manchego OR nutritional yeast (This substitution works best if recipe calls for cheese to be sprinkled over a dish. Nutritional yeast is low in fat, high in protein and B vitamins, and it's not made with any animal products.) OR cheese substitute OR oil-cured black olives (as a pizza topping) OR seasoned breadcrumbs (as a pizza topping)
