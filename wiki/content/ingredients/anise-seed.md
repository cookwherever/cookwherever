anise seed = aniseed = anis Pronunciation: ANN-us Notes: Cooks use anise seed to impart a licorice flavor to baked goods, liqueurs, and candies. Substitutes: fennel seed (This has a milder flavor and is sweeter than anise.) OR star anise (stronger flavor; 1 crushed star anise = 1/2 teaspoon crushed anise seed) OR caraway seed OR tarragon
