imitation vanilla extract = artificial vanilla extract = imitation vanilla flavor = artificial vanilla flavor = imitation vanilla flavoring = artificial vanilla flavoring = vanilla essence = vanilla flavoring This inexpensive substitute for pure vanilla extract is made with synthetic vanillin and other flavorings. Many brands are quite good, since chemists know how to produce an exact copy of natural vanillin, the dominant flavor in vanilla. The problem is that vanillin isn't the only flavor component in vanilla, so even the best imitation vanilla extracts aren't quite as full-flavored and complex as the real deal. Food gurus are always saying that cooks should never, ever use imitation vanilla extract, but at least one taste test has shown that many people prefer a high quality imitation vanilla extract to pure extract. Avoid imitation vanilla from Mexico--it may contain a toxic food additive. Substitutes: vanilla extract (more expensive, more complex flavor) OR vanilla powder (Some sources suggest substituting this measure for measure. Others suggest using half as powder as extract.)
