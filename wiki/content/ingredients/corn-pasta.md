corn pasta This is made with corn flour instead of the traditional durum wheat. It's popular among people with wheat allergies, but it tends to get mushy. Substitutes: polenta OR kamut� pasta (Kamut� contains gluten, but it's tolerated by many people with gluten allergies.) OR spelt pasta (Spelt contains gluten, but it's tolerated by many people with gluten allergies.) OR quinoa pasta (may contain corn flour as well) OR rice noodles
