bitter liqueurs = bitter spirits = bitters     These are liqueurs and fortified wines that have a bittersweet flavor.  They're often mixed with soda and served as apéritifs.   These liqueurs are sometimes called bitters, but they're not as intensely flavored as the  bitters that come in little bottles, which are normally measured out in drops.  Popular brands include Campari, Fernet Branca, Byrrh, Dubonnet, Punt è Mes,  Cynar, Suze, J�germeister,  and Amer Picon.
