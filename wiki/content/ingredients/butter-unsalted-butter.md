butter   This is a delicious solid fat churned from milk.  It's used in baking, frying, and as a spread on toast and muffins.  Recipes that call for butter in most better cookbooks are referring to unsalted butter = sweet cream butter = sweet butter.  Salted butter doesn't spoil as readily (the salt serves as a preservative).  See also the entries for whipped butter and European-style butter.   1 pound = 2 cups =  4 sticks.  1 stick  =  8 tablespoons. 1 stick salted butter = 1 stick unsalted butter + 3/8 teaspoon salt. (The salt content of salted butter can vary between brands.)
