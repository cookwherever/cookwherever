prickly pear = Indian fig = Indian pear = barbary fig = tuna = cactus pear The pulp of these cactus fruits is a brilliant red or, occasionally, a yellowish green, and it tastes a bit like watered-down watermelon. Cooks exploit the color by adding slices of the pulp to fruit salads, or by purï¿½eing it and straining out the seeds. They're quite popular in Hispanic countries and around the Mediterranean. Substitutes: pepino melon OR watermelon (much larger) rambutan Notes: These are similar to litchees and longans, but they're covered with soft spines. Substitutes: lychees (smaller) OR longans (smaller yet) Cooking hints: Peel before using.
