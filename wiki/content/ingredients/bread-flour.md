bread flour = hard-wheat flour = strong flour = high-gluten flour Notes: This flour has a high level of gluten, which gives bread more structure. Don't confuse it with gluten flour (also called vital wheat gluten), which is pure gluten and used as a bread additive or to make seitan. Substitutes: all-purpose flour (easier to knead; will result in smaller loaf; consider supplementing with gluten according to package directions or add 2 teaspoons per cup of flour) Notes: To see how to substitute other flours when making yeast breads, see the listing under all-purpose flour.
