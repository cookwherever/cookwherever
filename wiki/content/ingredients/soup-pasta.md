soup pasta = pasta in brodo = pastine = little pasta Notes: As a rule, the thinner the soup, the smaller the pasta. For broths and light soups, select from a large assortment of tiny shapes. Larger shapes, like tubetti or ditali, are perfect for minestrone or other hearty soups. Substitutes: angel-hair pasta ( broken into small pieces) OR fedelini ( broken into small pieces) OR vermicelli ( broken into small pieces)
