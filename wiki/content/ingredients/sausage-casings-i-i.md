sausage casings      These are traditionally made from intestines, but synthetic casings are now more common.  You can order them online, or prevail upon a friendly neighborhood butcher.  Substitutes:   cheesecloth (Use cheesecloth and string to shape sausages for poaching.  Remove cloth and string before grilling or frying the sausages.)
