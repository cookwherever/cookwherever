soynuts = soy nuts = roasted soybeans These are roasted soybeans that you eat like peanuts. They're about the shape of corn kernels, and sometimes coated with flavorings. Baked soynuts are lower in fat than fried. To make your own: Soak dried whole soybeans overnight, then rinse and drain. Season the beans if you like, then bake them in a 350ï¿½ oven, stirring occasionally, until they're light brown, about an hour. Alternatively, fry them in oil until they're light brown, about ten minutes.
