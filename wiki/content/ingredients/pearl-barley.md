pearl barley = pearled barley This is the most common form of barley, but not the most nutritious. While hulled barley loses only the thick outer hull in the milling process, pearl barley is stripped of the nutritious bran layer as well, leaving just the "pearl" inside. Despite this, it's still fairly nutritious. It takes about an hour to cook. Substitutes: hato mugi (slightly larger grains) OR arborio rice (not as chewy) OR orzo OR buckwheat groats (Works well in pilafs.)
