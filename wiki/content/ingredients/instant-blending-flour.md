instant-blending flour = instant flour = instantized flour = quick-mixing flour You can mix this granular all-purpose flour into liquids without getting many lumps, so it's perfect for making gravies and batters. It's also good for breading fish. Wondra flour and Shake & Blend are popular brands. Substitutes: (as a thickener) a roux of ordinary flour and butter (higher in calories) OR all-purpose flour (Mix this with water first to make a paste.) OR cornstarch (use half as much)
