, plastic wrap Notes: Plastic wrap is terrific for covering foods to be stored in the refrigerator or cooked in the microwave. It clings especially well to glass, ceramic, and china dishes. You can also use it to wrap foods for short-term freezer storage, though you should use aluminum foil if you're storing something in the freezer for a long time since foil is better at preventing moisture loss. Substitutes: plastic bags OR waxed paper (This is a good choice for separating layers of cookies or candies, or for covering or wrapping foods before microwaving. Waxed paper doesn't adhere well to food or containers and will let air in and steam out.) OR aluminum foil (Foil insulates food, making it slow to freeze or thaw. Aluminum also reacts with salty or acidic foods, diminishing flavor or appearance.),
