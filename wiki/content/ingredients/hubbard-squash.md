Hubbard squash This variety has tasty flesh, but it's too large for many families to hand and the rind is hard to cut though. Some grocers cut them into smaller pieces before putting them out. Substitutes: pumpkin OR golden delicious squash OR buttercup squash OR butternut squash (easier to peel when raw, sweet flavor) OR banana squash OR acorn squash OR green papaya
