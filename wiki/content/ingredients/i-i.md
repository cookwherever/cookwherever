Cooks and grocers define nuts as anything with edible kernels and hard shells.  This includes true nuts like chestnuts and acorns, but also things that botanists would class as seeds, like Brazil nuts, or legumes, like peanuts.  Nuts are usually high in fat and protein, and people throughout the world eat them as snacks or incorporate them into both sweet and savory dishes.  Many nuts can be eaten raw but roasting them helps intensify their flavor.   Nuts are usually harvested in the fall, and it's best to buy unprocessed nuts then.   Many unshelled nuts can be kept for up to a year in a cool place, but shelled nuts, especially those that have been cut or roasted, are more prone to rancidity and should be stored in the refrigerator or freezer in an airtight container.  Grape-nuts cereal OR dried fruit OR granola OR rolled oats (toast them first) OR chocolate chips (in sweet dishes)
