black bean =  turtle bean = black turtle bean = turtle soup bean = Mexican black bean = Spanish black bean = frijole negro  1 pound of dried beans = 2 cups dried beans = 6 cups of cooked beans  Notes:   These beans are a staple of Latin American and Caribbean cuisine, where they're used to make side dishes, soups, bean dips, and salads.  They have a strong, earthy flavor, so they're often combined with assertive flavorings.  Don't confuse black beans with fermented black beans.   appaloosa bean OR calypso bean (These are less flavorful than black beans, but they cook faster.) OR black soybeans (Unlike black beans, these won't darken the sauce they're cooked in.) OR azuku bean
