radish     With their crisp texture and peppery flavor, raw radishes are great in salads and on crudit� platters.  They can also be cut into attractive garnishes.  Select firm, fresh-looking radishes and store them in your refrigerator for no more than a week.    Substitutes: daikon (slightly hotter) OR jicama (for snacking) rutabaga = Swede turnip = Swede = yellow turnip   Pronunciation:  roo-tuh-BAY-guh Notes:   Rutabagas look like turnips, only they're a bit larger and have a yellow complexion.  Use them just as you would turnips.  Substitutes:   turnip (smaller, not as sweet; takes less time to cook) OR celeriac OR kohlrabi   salsify = goatsbeard = oyster plant = vegetable oyster    SAL-suh-fee OR SAL-suh-fie  Notes:   When cooked, salsify has the taste and texture of an artichoke heart.  There are two types:  white salsify (pictured at left) and the more highly regarded black salsify = scorzonera = black oyster plant = viper grass.  After peeling salsify, put it into acidulated water right away to prevent it from turning brown.  Canned salsify is a good substitute for fresh, but it's hard to find.     parsnip OR burdock OR Jerusalem artichoke OR artichoke heart OR asparagus OR turnip OR carrot
