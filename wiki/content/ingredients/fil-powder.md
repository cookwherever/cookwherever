fil� powder = fil� = gumbo file = gumbo fil� = ground sassafras leaves = sassafras leaves = file powder = file = fil powder = fil FEE-lay or fih-LAY Notes: This powder is made from the same leaves that used to give root beer its distinctive flavor, back in the days before artificial flavorings. Southerners add fil� to their gumbos to thicken and flavor them. The powder gets stringy when it's heated, so add it only after you've removed the gumbo from the heat source. Fil� also doesn't reheat well, so add it only to the gumbo that you're planning to eat right away. Substitutes: okra (Cooking this vegetable in your gumbo is another traditional way to thicken it.) OR cornstarch (This is another thickener, but it lacks fil�'s distinctive root beer-like flavor.)
