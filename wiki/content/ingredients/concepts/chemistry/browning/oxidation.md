title: Oxidation
---
* Enzymatic browning by being exposed to oxygen
* Cell walls need to be damaged (ie. when the food is cut, cell walls are damaged which speeds up browning)
* Cooking food will prevent oxidation (ex. cooking apples after cutting them will prevent browning when left at room temperature)
