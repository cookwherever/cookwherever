masa = masa dough = fresh masa MAH-suh Notes: This is a dough made from ground hominy that's widely used in Mexico to make tortillas and tamales. There are two kinds: The softer masa molida is used to make tortillas, while the coarser and thicker masa preparada is for tamales. Hispanic markets often sell ready-made masa in the refrigerated section, but you can easily make your own if you have masa flour. To make your own: Beat 1 cup lard until fluffy, then mix in 3 cups masa flour, 2 teaspoons salt, and 2 cups water.
