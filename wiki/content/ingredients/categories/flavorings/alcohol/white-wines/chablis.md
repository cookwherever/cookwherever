Chablis shah-BLEE Notes: If made in France, this is a very dry, delicately flavored white wine that's made with Chardonnay grapes. It's great with seafood, especially oysters. If made domestically, like a California Chablis, it's a sweet and cheap jug wine. Substitutes: Pouilly-Fuissï¿½ OR Chardonnay OR Pinot blanc OR Sauvignon Blanc OR Muscadet OR vermouth (Use this substitute for cooking, not drinking. Use dry vermouth only.)
