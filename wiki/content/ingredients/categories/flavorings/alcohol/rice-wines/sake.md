sake = sak� = saki = rice wine SAH-kee Notes: This is a Japanese rice wine, or more correctly, beer. It's usually served warm in tiny porcelain cups, but some trendy American restaurants served it chilled like white wine. Sake doesn't age well in the bottle and should be consumed within a year of bottling. Substitutes: Shaoxing wine (not as smooth and sweet) OR vermouth (dry) OR white wine OR sherry (dry)
