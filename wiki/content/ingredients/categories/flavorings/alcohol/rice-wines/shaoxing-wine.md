Shaoxing wine = Shaohsing wine = Shao hsing wine = Hsao Shing wine = Chinese rice wine Notes: Chinese rice wine varies in quality, so cookbooks often specify Shaoxing rice wine, which is quite good. The Chinese drink it from small porcelain cups, in the same way that the Japanese drink their sake. Shaoxing cooking wine may be salted. Substitutes: sake (smoother and sweeter) OR sherry (dry)
