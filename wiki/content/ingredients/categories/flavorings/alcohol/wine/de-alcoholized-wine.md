de-alcoholized wine = dealcoholized wine These aren't as flavorful as ordinary wine, but they're a good choice for people who want to drink wine without consuming alcohol. Sparkling wines are the most popular de-alcoholized wines, but other varieties are also available. Many brands contain small amounts of alcohol. Substitutes: wine essence OR sparkling grape juice OR sparkling cider OR equal parts verjus and club soda, sweetened to taste with simple syrup. OR wine (Alcohol evaporates at a lower temperature than water, so cooking with wine will eliminate some or even most of the alcohol, but not all of it.)
