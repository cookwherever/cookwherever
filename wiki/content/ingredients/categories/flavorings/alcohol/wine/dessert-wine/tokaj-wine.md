Tokaj wine = Tokay wine toe-KAY Notes: Ordinary Tokay table wine is mediocre, but some Tokay grapes are affected by Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that pokes holes in their skins and makes them shrivel on the vine. This concentrates the sweetness and makes for an exquisite dessert wine. Look for bottles labeled Tokay Aszï¿½, the Hungarian name for botrytised Tokay wine.
