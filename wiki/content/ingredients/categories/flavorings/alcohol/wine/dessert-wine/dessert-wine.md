dessert wine These are sweet wines that are served with (or instead of) dessert. Examples include fortified wines like port and sherry, and late harvest wines, which are made from grapes that have shriveled a bit, concentrating their sweetness. As a rule of thumb, a dessert wine should always be sweeter than the dessert it accompanies. Substitutes: sparkling wine OR liqueur OR coffee (This is another beverage traditionally served with dessert.)
