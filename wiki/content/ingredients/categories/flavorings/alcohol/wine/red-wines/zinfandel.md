Zinfandel = Zin ZIN-fan-dell Notes: This is a hearty red varietal wine that's especially good with sausages and barbecued meats. Don't confuse it with white Zinfandel, a fruity blush wine that wine snobs abhor. California Zinfandels are often excellent. Substitutes: Chianti OR Syrah OR Merlot OR Cabernet Sauvignon OR Rhone wines (red)
