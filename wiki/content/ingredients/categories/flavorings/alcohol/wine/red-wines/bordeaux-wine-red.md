Bordeaux wine (red) = claret bore-DOUGH Notes: The Bordeaux region in France produces excellent red wines, especially in the districts of M�doc, Haut-M�doc, and St. Emilion. These wines are rich and complex, and usually made with a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot grapes. Bordeaux wines with the generic label "Bordeaux Wine" usually aren't as good as those with more specific appellations, like "St. Emilion Wine." Red Bordeaux wines go especially well with lamb and poultry. Substitutes: Cabernet Sauvignon OR Merlot OR Burgundy
