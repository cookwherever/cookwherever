"Blush" is displacing "ros�" as the name given to pink wines, though some people use the name ros� to describe darker pink wines. Whatever name you give them, they're usually made from red grapes that are only allowed to ferment a few days--too short a time for the grape skins to impart a deeper color to the wine. The result is a pink, fruity wine that's best served chilled and goes best with poultry, seafood, and spicy dishes. These wines are quite popular, but wine snobs think they're boring. Don't cook with these wines--they aren't flavorful enough. Substitutes: Gew�rztraminer OR Beaujolais OR white wine
