grappa = grapa = marc = eau-de-vie de marc = eau de vie de marc = aguardiente = testerbranntwein = bagaceira = pomace brandy GRAH-pah Notes: This potent and somewhat harsh drink is made from the grape residue, called pomace, that's left over from making brandy. It's traditionally been thought of as a second-rate eau de vie, but some producers have developed premium grappas that are quite smooth and very pricey. Grappa is the Italian version, marc the French, aguardiente the Spanish, testerbranntwein the German, and bagaceira the Portuguese. Substitutes: raki OR apple brandy OR pear brandy OR cognac OR armagnac
