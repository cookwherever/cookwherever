Bourbon whiskey = Bourbon whisky = Bourbon = Kentucky whiskey Though milder than Scotch, Bourbon is well regarded by whiskey connoisseurs.

Whiskey should be served at room temperature. Substitutes: blended whiskey OR sour-mash whiskey (This has a milder flavor.) OR Scotch (especially for sipping) OR cognac (especially for cooking) OR rum OR Substitute one part vanilla extract plus two parts water for each tablespoon of bourbon.
