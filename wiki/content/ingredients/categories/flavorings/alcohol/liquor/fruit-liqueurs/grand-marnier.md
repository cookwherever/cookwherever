There are two kinds: the well-regarded red, or Cordon Rouge, and the sweeter and less potent yellow, or Cordon Jaune. Substitutes: Cointreau (Also an orange flavored liqueur. Not as good for sipping, but works fine for cooking.) OR curaï¿½ao (This is also an orange-flavored liqueur, but it's sweeter than Grand Marnier.) OR triple sec (orange-flavored, much sweeter) OR cognac (Not orange flavored, but it's a good substitute for sipping or cooking.) OR Chambord (similar quality, but raspberry-flavored) OR unsweetened orange juice concentrate
