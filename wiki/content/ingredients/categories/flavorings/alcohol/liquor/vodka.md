vodka This flavorless, colorless liquor is a great mixer, since it blends unobtrusively with other ingredients. Some prefer to drink it straight, poured from bottles they store in the freezer. Since vodka is virtually flavorless, the differences between the brands are all but imperceptible to the mortal tongue. Buy the cheapest brand if you're using the vodka in mixed drinks. Flavored vodkas also are available; here the differences in quality may be more noticeable. Substitutes: gin (this is the preferred liquor for martinis) OR white rum OR aquavit (works fine in a Bloody Mary) OR dry white wine OR tequila
