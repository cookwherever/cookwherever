B�n�dictine = B�n�dictine D.O.M. = Benedictine This light green liqueur was first produced in the 16th century by a French monk, who combined various herbs, spices, and peels with brandy. It's somewhat sweet by itself, so many people cut it with brandy or buy B&B, which is premixed B�n�dictine and brandy. The letters D.O.M. stand for Deo Optimo Maximo (To God, the best and greatest), which is the B�n�dictine motto. Substitutes: B&B (a blend of B�n�dictine and brandy) OR Chartreuse (very expensive) OR Drambuie
