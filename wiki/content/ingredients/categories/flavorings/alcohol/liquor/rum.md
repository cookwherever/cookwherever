rum Rum is a key ingredient in many chilled drinks, like daiquiris, piï¿½a coladas, and Planter's punch. It's used in the kitchen, too, especially in cakes or fruit-based desserts. Rum is distilled from sugar cane, and most of it comes from cane-producing Caribbean countries. Its character varies according to its color. White rums are relatively dry and light, and commonly used in mixed drinks. The amber rums from Puerto Rico, Trinidad, and the Virgin Islands are heavier and more flavorful. The dark rums from Jamaica and Haiti are heavier still, and have a pronounced molasses flavor. Demerara rums are the darkest and heaviest of all. There also are aromatic rums that are flavored with fruits and spices. Substitutes: brandy OR 1 tablespoon rum extract + 1/2 cup apple juice OR 1 tablespoon rum extract + 1/2 cup water OR Bourbon OR sherry OR gin OR orange liqueur OR orange juice OR pineapple juice OR vodka (flavorless)
