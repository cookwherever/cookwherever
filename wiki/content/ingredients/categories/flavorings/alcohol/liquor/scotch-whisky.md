Scotch whisky = Scotch The king of whiskies, Scotch has a very distinctive, smoky flavor. Single-malt Scotch whisky is considered the best--it has a stronger, more complex flavor than blended Scotch, which is a mixture of malt whiskies and grain whiskies. Connoisseurs of single-malt Scotch consider Macallan to be one of the finest brands. Of the blended Scotch whiskies, the more highly-esteemed brands include Chivas Regal and Johnnie Walker Black Label. Use the cheaper blended Scotch for mixed drinks. Whiskey should be served at room temperature. Substitutes: Bourbon OR Irish whiskey (This is heavier than Scotch, and lacks its smoky flavor.) OR 1 part vanilla extract + 2 parts water OR gin OR sherry
