grain alcohol = ethanol = ethyl alcohol =grain neutral spirits = pure grain alcoholThis is pure alcohol--odorless, tasteless, and very potent at 190 proof. Cooks use it to make liqueurs, but since it can also be used to purify crack cocaine, eyebrows may be raised if you buy a large bottle. Well-known brands include Everclear and Sunset. Grain alcohol should always be diluted before consumption, since it's so harsh and potent. Don't substitute methyl alcohol or rubbing alcohol for grain alcohol--both of these are toxic. Substitutes: vodka (This is also used to make liqueurs. Since it's half as potent as grain alcohol, use twice as much, then reduce another liquid in the recipe accordingly.)
