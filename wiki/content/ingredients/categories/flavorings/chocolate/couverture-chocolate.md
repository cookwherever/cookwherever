couverture chocolate = couverture-grade chocolate = coating chocolate = commercial coating chocolate Pronunciation: KOO-ver-chure Notes: Couverture means covering in French, and professionals use this type of chocolate to coat candies and glaze cakes. It has a higher percentage of cocoa butter than ordinary chocolate, which makes for glossier coatings and a richer flavor. Available in bittersweet, semi-sweet, white, and milk chocolate. It's expensive, and you may need to go to a specialty store to find it. Substitutes: compound chocolate coating (Not as rich and tasty, but easier to work with) OR ordinary chocolate
