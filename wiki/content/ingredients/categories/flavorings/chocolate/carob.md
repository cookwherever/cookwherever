carob = St. John's bread = honey locust = locust bean CARE-ub Notes: Carob is sometimes used as a substitute by those unfortunates who are allergic to chocolate, since its flavor is vaguely similar. Others use it as a healthy alternative to chocolate, since it contains less fat and no caffeine. It's available as raw pods, chips, and either as toasted or untoasted powder (toasting helps bring out the flavor). Look for it in health food stores. Substitutes: cocoa powder (Most cookbooks call for cocoa to be substituted for carob measure for measure, but since cocoa has a stronger flavor, you should use less. Cocoa powder has more fat than carob powder, and some caffeine. Since carob burns more easily than cocoa, the recipe may call for a lower oven temperature than is necessary with cocoa powder.)
