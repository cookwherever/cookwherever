chocolate curls = chocolate shavings = shaved chocolate This is a pretty and easily-made garnish for desserts. The curls are fragile, so it's best to move them around with a toothpick. To make your own: Warm a square of sweet, semi-sweet, bittersweet, white, or milk chocolate in the microwave at 50% power for about 30 seconds, then shave curls from it using a vegetable peeler. If the chocolate crumbles, it's too cold. Substitutes: Use a grater to grate chocolate onto the dessert you're garnishing. OR dust with cocoa
