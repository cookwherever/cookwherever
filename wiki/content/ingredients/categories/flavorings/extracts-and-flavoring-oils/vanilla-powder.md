vanilla powder This alcohol-free powder is made from vanilla beans that have been dried and pulverized. Unlike vanilla extract, it doesn't evaporate when heated, so it's well suited to making custards and other cooked desserts. It's also good for making dry mixes and for sprinkling onto drinks and dishes. Some brands have sweeteners added. Look for it in larger supermarkets and specialty shops. Substitutes: vanilla extract (Some sources suggest substituting this measure for measure. Others suggest using twice as much extract as powder.) OR imitation vanilla extract (Some sources suggest substituting this measure for measure. Others suggest using twice as much extract as powder.)
