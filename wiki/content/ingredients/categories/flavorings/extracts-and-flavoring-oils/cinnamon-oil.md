cinnamon oil This is sometimes used as a home remedy for toothaches, but cooks also use it to make hard candies and cinnamon apples. Substitutes: cinnamon extract (Extracts evaporate easily, and therefore can't withstand high heat or prolonged cooking. Four units of extract is roughly equivalent to one unit of flavoring oil, but this may vary according to the products used. Begin by substituting two units of extract per unit of flavoring oil, then add more extract until you're satisfied with the flavor.)
