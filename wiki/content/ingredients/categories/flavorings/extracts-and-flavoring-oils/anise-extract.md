anise extract Pronunciation: ANN-us Notes: This tastes like licorice, and it's typically used to flavor cakes and cookies. Substitutes: anise oil (One part flavoring oil is roughly equivalent to four parts extract, but this may vary according to the products used. To be safe, begin by substituting 1/8 teaspoon of oil per teaspoon of extract, then add more drops of oil until you're satisfied with the flavor.) OR anise-flavored liqueur (Substitute 1 or 2 tablespoons liqueur for each teaspoon of anise extract) OR aniseed (Substitute 2 teaspoons ground aniseed for each teaspoon of anise extract.) OR vanilla extract
