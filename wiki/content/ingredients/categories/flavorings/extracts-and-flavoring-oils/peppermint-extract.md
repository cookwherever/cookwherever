peppermint extract This is used to make candy canes, mints, and peppermint patties. Substitutes: peppermint oil (One part flavoring oil is roughly equivalent to four parts extract, but this may vary according to the products used. To be safe, begin by substituting 1/8 teaspoon of oil per teaspoon of extract, then add more drops of oil until you're satisfied with the flavor.) OR creme de menthe (use much more) OR peppermint schnapps (Substitute 1 or 2 tablespoons schnapps for each teaspoon of extract) OR vanilla extract (use more)
