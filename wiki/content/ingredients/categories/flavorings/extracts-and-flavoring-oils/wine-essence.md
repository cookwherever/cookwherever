wine essence = wine extract = wine syrup This is wine that's been reduced to a syrup, which de-alcoholizes it and allows it to be stored for a longer period of time. Professional chefs sometimes make this to use up half-empty bottles of wine that would otherwise go bad in a few days. The syrup can be used in sauces or other dishes that call for wine. To make your own: Reduce wine by slowly simmering it in a non-reactive pan (i.e., avoid aluminum or iron) to a thick, syrupy consistency, then refrigerate it and use small amounts to flavor dishes. One bottle of wine makes about one cup.
