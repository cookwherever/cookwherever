preserved lemon = salt-cured lemon These are lemons that have been preserved in a salty brine for one or two months. They're a staple of Moroccan cuisine and somewhat hard to find in the U.S. To make your own: See the footnote in the Preserved Lemon Martini recipe posted by Global Gourmet, or the recipes for Preserved Lemons or Preserved Lemon Quarters posted on RecipeSource.com. Substitutes: Make deep cuts into the peel of a lemon and fill the cuts with coarse salt, then wrap the lemon in a plastic bag and refrigerate for 24 hours.
