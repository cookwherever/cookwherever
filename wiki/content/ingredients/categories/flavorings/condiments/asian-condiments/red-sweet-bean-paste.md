red sweet bean paste = red bean paste = red bean sauce = sweet red bean paste This is made from azuki beans, and Asian cooks use it to fill buns and dumplings and to make puddings. Like peanut butter, it comes in both creamy and crunchy versions. The creamy version also comes in powdered form. Don't confuse this with sweet bean paste, which is made from sweetened fermented soybeans. To make your own: Cook a cup of azuki beans until they're soft (about 1 1/2 hours), then puree the softened beans in a food processor. Pour the puree into a cotton kitchen towel and squeeze out the water. Put what's left into a saucepan, add 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup shortening, and a pinch of salt, and heat while stirring until it's thickened to the consistency of miso.
