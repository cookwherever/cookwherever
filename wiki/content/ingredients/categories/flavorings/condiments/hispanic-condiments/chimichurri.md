title: Chimichurri
---
### Ingredients
#### herbs
signature flavor, bulk of the volume
- Handful of fresh [[parsley]]

### fat
texture, enhances fat soluble flavors (aromatics and spices)
- [[olive-oil]]

### acid
provides brightness, contrasts with smokey flavor 
- [[red-wine-vinegar]]

### aromatics and spices
supplemental flavors (add more if you like one of these flavors)
- [[red-pepper-flakes]]
- [[garlic]]
- [[oregano]]
- [[salt]]

### Notes
- "vinaigrette with three to four times as much herbs and aromatics" 
- you can create any sauce that you want if you use the herbs, fat, acid, and aromatics as a blueprint (ie. you can use a [[lime]] instead of [[red-wine-vinegar]] since the lime is acidic)

#### Cut vs Blending
- Cutting
	- leaves larger chunks of ingredients for chunkier texture and visual appearance
	- you can taste each ingredient in different bites
- Blending
	- makes process easier, smoother texture 
	- like a paste
