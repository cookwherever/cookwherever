It�s best to buy horseradish in small amounts and store it in the refrigerator�it turns dark and loses much of its bite after a few months. Look for it in the deli case. Varieties: The most common is white horseradish, which is made with vinegar. Creamed horseradish = cream-style horseradish has a little mayonnaise and/or sour cream added; horseradish sauce has a lot. Red horseradish = beet horseradish is made with beet juice. To make your own: When exposed to air, the flesh of the horseradish root begins an enzymatic reaction that causes it to become increasingly pungent within the first few minutes, and then milder after that. Adding a sour liquid stops the reaction and locks in the heat for several months. If you�re making your own white horseradish, make sure your kitchen is well ventilated, wear rubber gloves, and avoid touching your eyes. Begin by preparing a sour liquid solution of one cup vinegar and one teaspoon salt. Next, peel a horseradish root, chop it into small pieces, and grind it in a blender, adding just enough water to enable the blade to turn freely. To make a mild sauce, immediately mix in � cup of the vinegar solution for each cup of grated horseradish root. To make the sauce hotter, add the solution after a few minutes when the pungency is peaking. Refrigerate or freeze until ready to use. Substitutes: grated horseradish root OR wasabi (This Japanese condiment comes in green paste or powder.) OR wasabi cream sauce OR grated wasabi root (This is hard to find in American markets.)
