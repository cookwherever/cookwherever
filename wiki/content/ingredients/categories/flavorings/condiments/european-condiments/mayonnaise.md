mayonnaise To make your own: See RecipeSource.com postings for Mayonnaise, Homemade Mayonnaise and Eggless Mock Mayonnaise. Substitutes: mustard OR roasted garlic (as a sandwich spread) OR aioli OR yogurt (especially in chicken or tuna salads; less rich tasting but lower in calories) OR mashed avocados (This is a good sandwich spread. Avocados are also high in fat, but it's most monounsaturated fat, which isn't as harmful as other kinds of fat.) mint sauce The British like to serve this with roast lamb. To make your own: Bring to a boil 1/2 cup cider vinegar mixed with 1 teaspoon sugar. Pour over 1/4 cup chopped mint and stir.
