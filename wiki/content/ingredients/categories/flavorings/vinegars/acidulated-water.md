uh-SIJ-uh-lay-tid Notes: This is water that's been mixed with a small amount of lemon juice or vinegar to make it slightly acidic. If you put freshly sliced fruits or vegetables in acidulated water, they won't darken. To make your own: Mix one or two tablespoons of lemon juice or vinegar with one quart of water.
