seasoned rice vinegar = seasoned rice wine vinegar = sushi vinegar Accomplished Asian cooks who find this in your pantry are likely to purse their lips, just as Italian cooks would over a packet of spaghetti sauce mix. So keep it well hidden. It's lightly flavored with sugar and salt, and saves time when making sushi. You can also use it to dress salads, vegetables, and other dishes. Substitutes: 3/4 cup white rice vinegar plus 1/4 cup sugar plus 2 teaspoons salt.
