ras el hanout A traditional Moroccan spice mix, the name means "head of the shop," suggesting that it was the master of the spice shop who prepared this complex blend. It's often cooked with rice and couscous dishes. Look for it in Middle Eastern markets or African markets. To make your own: Grind together 4 teaspoons each cumin seed and ground ginger, 5 teaspoons coriander seeds, 2 tablespoons each black peppercorns and ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 16 whole cloves, and 20 allspice berries (adapted from a recipe in Paula Wolfert's World of Food. See my sources.)
