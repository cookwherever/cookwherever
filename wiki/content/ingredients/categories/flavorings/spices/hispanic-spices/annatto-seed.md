annatto seed = achiote seed = annotto seed = achote seed = achuete seed = atsuete seed = bija = bijol = roucou Annatto seeds don't have a lot of flavor, but they impart a rich yellowish-orange color to stews and sauces. Look for the seeds, either whole or ground, in Latin American or Caribbean markets. To extract the color, steep the seeds in boiling water for about 20 minutes, then discard the seeds. Substitutes: yellow food coloring OR hot paprika OR equal parts turmeric and paprika
