fennel seed = fennel = sweet cumin FEN-uhl Notes: This is similar to anise seed, but sweeter and milder. It pairs well with fish, but Italians also like to add it to sauces, meat balls, and sausages. Both the seeds and the stalks from the plant are sometimes called fennel. If a recipe calls for a large amount, it probably intends for you to use the stalks. Substitutes: anise seed OR cumin OR caraway seeds OR dill
