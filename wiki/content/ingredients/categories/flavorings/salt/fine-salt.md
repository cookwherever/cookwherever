fine salt = finely-ground salt = fine-grain salt = fin sel This is salt that's been ground into small grains. Most recipes calling for salt intend for you to use finely ground salt, though coarse salt is better for certain things, like making beds for oysters and salt crusts on meat or fish, or for lining baking dishes or the rims of margarita glasses. Table salt usually comes finely ground. Substitutes: coarse salt (Grind it using a salt mill, mortar & pestle, or rolling pin.)
