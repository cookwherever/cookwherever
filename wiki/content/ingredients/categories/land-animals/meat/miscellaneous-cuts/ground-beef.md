### Notes
This varies in quality depending upon what part of the carcass the meat came from. Ground chuck has a high fat content, which means it makes the juiciest hamburgers and meatloaf. Ground round is very lean, and a good choice if you're trying to reduce the fat in your diet. Ground sirloin is also lean, but it's more flavorful (and more expensive) than ground round.

Percentage of meat to fat is important.

### Substitutes
- ground chicken
- ground turkey
- ground lamb
- portobello mushrooms (These are great for grilling; don't wash or marinate, just brush with oil while they're on the grill.)
- TVP
