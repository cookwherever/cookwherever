p�t� = pate = pat� = liver paste Pronunciation: pah-TAY Notes: Leave it to the French to come up with this buttery rich delicacy. Goose p�t� is pricier and more subtle than duck p�t�, and is the best choice if you plan to serve the p�t� cold. Duck p�t� works best in warm dishes. Some people refuse to eat p�t� de foie gras from France because the animals are force-fed to enlarge their livers. Substitutes: liverwurst OR foie gras entier OR monkfish liver
