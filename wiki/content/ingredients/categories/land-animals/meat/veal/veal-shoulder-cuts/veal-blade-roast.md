veal blade roast This cut includes the shoulder blade bone and a fair amount of connective tissue, so it's cheaper than other veal roasts. Once boned, it has a nice large opening that can be stuffed before roasting. A steak cut from a blade roast is called a veal blade steak. Substitutes: veal arm roast OR veal breast roast (also good for stuffing)
