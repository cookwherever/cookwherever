veal cutlet = veal leg cutlet = veal scaloppini cutlet = veal scallopini cutlet = veal scallop = veal scaloppini = veal scallopini = veal escalopes These are very lean and thin boneless slices taken from different muscles in the leg. Better butchers cut them to order, since they dry out quickly in the display case, and then they sometimes pound them to make them even thinner. They're most commonly used to make scaloppini, schnitzels, and escalopes. Substitutes: pork cutlet (pound this to make it thinner) OR turkey (This is less expensive. Use breast slices and pound them to make them thinner.) OR chicken (This is less expensive. Use breast slices and pound them to make them thinner.)
