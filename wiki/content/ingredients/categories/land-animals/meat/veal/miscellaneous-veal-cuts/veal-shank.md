veal shank Portions of both the fore shank and the hind shank are sold as shank bones. They're rich in gelatinous substances, so they're excellent for making stocks, soups, and osso buco. Substitutes: beef shank (cheaper and works well in osso buco) OR veal arm roast (cheaper and also works well in osso buco) OR lamb shank OR veal rump roast
