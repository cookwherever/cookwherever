veal rib roast = rack of veal A rib roast is often cut into tender rib chops, but some people roast it intact or tie two or three rib roasts together to form a crown roast of veal. A hotel rack includes the connected rib racks from both sides of the animal. Be careful not to overcook veal; since it isn't very fatty it tends to dry out easily. Rib roasts are sold either with or without bones. Substitutes: lamb rib roast (makes a superior crown roast) OR standing beef roast (more fat)
