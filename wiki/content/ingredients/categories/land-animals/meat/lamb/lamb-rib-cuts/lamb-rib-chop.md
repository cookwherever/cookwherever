lamb rib chop Notes: These exquisite chops are cut from a rack of lamb. They usually contain one rib per chop, but you'll get a thicker and juicier steak with double cut lamb rib chop, which includes two ribs. If the meat at the tip is cut away to expose the bone, it's called a French lamb chop = Frenched lamb chop (shown in the picture). Substitutes: lamb loin chop OR lamb sirloin steak
