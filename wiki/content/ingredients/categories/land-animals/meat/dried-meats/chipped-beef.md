chipped beef = dried beef These are thin slices of salty dried beef that are usually sold in jars. During World War II, chipped beef was commonly served in a cream sauce on toast. Called "shit on a shingle," it was a dish that managed to taste awful despite its high levels of fat and sodium. Now that we enjoy a higher standard of living, chipped beef has thankfully fallen into relative obscurity. Substitutes: beef jerky (works well in creamed chipped beef on toast recipes)
