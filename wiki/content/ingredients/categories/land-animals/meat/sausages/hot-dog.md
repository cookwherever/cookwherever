hot dog = wiener = weiner (a common misspelling) = frankfurter = frank = tube steak = wienerwurst = griddle Notes: An American staple, hot dogs are mild, smoked, and usually skinless sausages that are traditionally served in a bun with relish and mustard. They've declined in popularity in recent years because they're relatively high in fat and sodium. This decline was hastened in late 1998 when several people died after being exposed to Listeria, a deadly bacterium which was traced to some improperly prepared hot dogs and deli meats. Substitutes: Vienna sausage OR bockwurst OR banger Links: See the USDA fact sheet on hot dogs.
