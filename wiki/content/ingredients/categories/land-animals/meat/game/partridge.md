partridge These small, plump birds are related to pheasants, and very tasty. Varieties include the chukar, red-legged partridge = French partridge, and grey partridge = English partridge. Substitutes: grouse (very similar) OR pheasant (These are larger than partridges.) OR dove OR quail (These are smaller than partridges, so use half again as many.) OR Cornish game hen
