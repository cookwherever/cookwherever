pot roast These are economical roasts that are too tough to be oven roasted, but they become tender if cooked in a liquid for several hours. Several cuts work well as pot roasts, particularly the 7-bone pot roast, arm roast, blade roast, chuck eye, cross rib roast, shoulder roast, top blade pot roast, under blade pot roast, bottom round roast, eye round roast, and rump roast.
