7-bone steak = center chuck steak This is an economical steak cut from a 7-bone pot roast. It's rather tough, so your best bet is to braise it. If you insist on grilling or broiling it, be sure to marinate it overnight to make it as tender as possible. Substitutes: top blade steak OR under blade steak
