top blade steak = book steak = butler steak = lifter steak = petite steak = top chuck steak = flat iron steak Though a lowly chuck steak, this cut is tender enough to grill, broil, or pan-fry, as long as you marinate it first. If you don't mind cutting around some gristle, this is an economical and flavorful steak. It's also great for making fajitas. Substitutes: eye of round steak OR top sirloin OR round tip steak
