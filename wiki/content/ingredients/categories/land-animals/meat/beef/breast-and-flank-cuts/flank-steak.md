flank steak Notes: This is a lean, flat cut that's fairly tender and extremely flavorful. Properly marinated, it's a wonderful steak to grill or broil, but don't overcook it or it will become very tough. Before serving, cut the steak into thin slices at a slant against the grain. Substitutes: skirt steak OR hanger steak OR top round (for London broil) OR tri-tip roast,
