skirt steak = beef plate skirt steak = fajita meat = Philadelphia steak Notes: These look like thick-grained flank steaks, and they're the cut of choice for making fajitas. Since they're marbled with fat, they also make for very juicy steaks. It's best to pound them flat, marinate briefly, then cook them over high heat. Substitutes: flank steak OR hanger steak
