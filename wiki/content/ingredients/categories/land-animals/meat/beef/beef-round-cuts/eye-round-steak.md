eye round steak = eye steak = eye of round steak This is a small, boneless steak cut from an eye round roast. It's tough, so it's sometimes cut into stew meat or processed into cube steak. It's also good braised, but it will require the tenderizing effects of a marinade if you want to grill or broil it. If cut thinly, this steak is sometimes called a breakfast steak = wafer steak = sandwich steak = minute steak. Substitutes: top blade steak OR top sirloin OR round tip steak
