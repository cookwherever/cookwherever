round tip roast = tip roast = sirloin tip roast = tip sirloin roast This roast is just a cut away from the sirloin, so it's tender enough to be oven roasted or cut up into kabobs. If the roast is trimmed of some fat and muscle, it's called a trimmed tip roast = ball tip roast. Substitutes: tri-tip roast OR rump roast
