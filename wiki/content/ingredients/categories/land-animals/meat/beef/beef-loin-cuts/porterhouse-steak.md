Porterhouse steak Notes: Many believe these to be the best of all steaks. They include parts of two muscles: the flavorful top loin and the buttery soft tenderloin. It's best to grill or broil them without marinating. Substitutes: T-bone steak (Very similar, but not quite as tender) OR club steak OR rib steak OR strip steak
