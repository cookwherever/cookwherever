T-bone steak Named for its distinguishing T-shaped bone, this choice cut is almost identical to a Porterhouse steak, only it doesn't have as much of the tenderloin muscle in it. It's usually grilled or broiled. Substitutes: Porterhouse steak (a bit more tender) OR club steak (a bit less tender) OR sirloin steak OR strip steak OR rib eye steak
