pork loin This is where we get the leanest and most tender pork cuts. Since they're lean, these cuts tend to dry out if overcooked. Pork is safe to eat if it's cooked to an interior temperature of 160 degrees. There are three main parts of the loin: the blade end, which is closest to the shoulder and tends to be fatty; the sirloin end, which is closest to the rump and tends to be bony; and the center portion in the middle, which is lean, tender, and expensive.
