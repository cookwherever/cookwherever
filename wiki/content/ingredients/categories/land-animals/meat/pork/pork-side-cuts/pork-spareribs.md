pork spareribs = pork spare ribs These aren't as meaty as country-style ribs or back ribs, but they're popular at barbecues since they're easy to eat with your fingers. Allow 4/5 pound per person. St. Louis style ribs are spareribs that have been trimmed of the brisket bone. Substitutes: pork country-style ribs (meatier and fattier) OR pork back ribs (thinner and leaner)
