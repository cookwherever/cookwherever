city ham = brine-cured ham = pumped ham = wet-cured ham Notes: This is America's most popular ham, the kind that's pink, moist, and sweet. Fresh hams are soaked in brine (or injected with it) and then boiled or lightly smoked. Boneless hams = boned hams are easier to carve, but they're not as flavorful or attractive as bone-in hams. A good compromise is to buy a bone-in spiral-sliced ham, which combines good flavor and convenience, or a ham steak (pictured at right). City hams usually come fully cooked (check the label), but most people reheat them before serving. Substitutes: picnic ham (This is cured like a ham, but cut from the hog's shoulder. It's not as tender and lean as a true ham and it cooks much quicker.) OR country ham (saltier, but with a more complex flavor)
