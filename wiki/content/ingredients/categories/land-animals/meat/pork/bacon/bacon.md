bacon = American bacon = streaky bacon (British) BAY-kuhn Notes: Bacon is a very fatty slab taken from the underside of a pig. The bacon sold in markets is usually cured and smoked, but it's also possible to buy uncured fresh bacon = pork belly = side pork. Smoked bacon is often fried and served with eggs or in sandwiches, or it's sometimes wrapped around lean meats to keep them moist while they're cooking. Substitutes: turkey bacon (less fat, doesn't shrink as much as regular bacon) OR vegetarian bacon OR imitation bacon bits OR smoked ham OR Canadian bacon (leaner) OR pancetta OR salt pork (in sauces) OR smoked sausage OR ham OR fatback (for barding)
