### Notes
Bacon is a very fatty slab taken from the underside of a pig. The bacon sold in markets is usually cured and smoked, but it's also possible to buy uncured fresh bacon = pork belly = side pork. Smoked bacon is often fried and served with eggs or in sandwiches, or it's sometimes wrapped around lean meats to keep them moist while they're cooking.

* Typically 60% fat 40% meat, but can also be 50% fat and 50% meat
* Bacon goes through a [[curing]] process
* Uncured bacon contains just as many nitrites/nitrates as cured bacon. Bacon producers want to appeal to people who are worried about consuming these compounds by saying the bacon is only cured with celery salt, which is high in these compounds.
* Can be dry cured and wet cured: a wet cure has a salt solution injected into the bacon to speed up curing process
	* This accounts for much of the splattering that you get when you fry up bacon. The water is rapidly evaporated, and when it goes to leave the bacon it kicks up the grease that is on top of it, sending it flying.
* Smoking is used to give bacon a smoky flavor. The thicker the slice of bacon, the more smoky flavor is captured.
* Thinner bacon will fry into a more crispy bacon.
