### Notes
Pancetta is the Italian counterpart to our bacon. It's cured, but not smoked, and it's often used to give a subtle salty flavor to pasta sauces. Deli counters often carry cylinders of it, and slice it to order.

### Substitutes
* equal parts prosciutto and salt pork
* unsmoked lean bacon
* bacon (Blanch it first in boiling water for a couple of minutes to tone down the smoky flavor.)
* prosciutto
