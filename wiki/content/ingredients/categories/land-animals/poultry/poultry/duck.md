duck Notes: This fatty bird makes a divine roast, but it's hard to cook without setting off the smoke alarm. It helps to pour off the fat while it's roasting. Wild ducks are less fatty than store-bought ducks. A young duck, called a duckling = young duckling = broiler duckling = fryer duckling = roaster duckling, is more tender than an old duck = mature duck. High fat meats like duck generally should be cooked at a higher temperature and for a longer time than low-fat meats. Substitutes: goose (less fatty) OR chicken (less fatty still)
