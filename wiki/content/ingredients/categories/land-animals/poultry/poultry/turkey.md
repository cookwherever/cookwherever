turkey Equivalents: One pound boneless turkey = 3 cups. Notes: Markets often sell whole turkeys at bargain prices during the holidays, using them as loss leaders. It's a good idea to stock up on them then, since you can keep them in the freezer for up to a year and serve your family this cheap, lean, tasty meat year-round. If you're planning to roast a whole turkey, choose a young turkey = fryer-roaster turkey = young hen turkey = young tom turkey. An old turkey = mature turkey = yearling turkey isn't as tender and is best cooked in a stew or soup.
