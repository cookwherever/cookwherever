duck egg Compared to chicken eggs, these are larger, higher in fat, more colorful, and more flavorful. They're sometimes contaminated with bacteria, so make sure you cook them thoroughly. Substitutes: chicken egg (smaller and not as oily, colorful, and flavorful) egg = chicken egg Equivalents: One egg contains about one tablespoon of egg yolk and two tablespoons of egg white and weighs about two ounces without the shell. Varieties: Eggs come in different sizes. Most recipes assume that you're using large eggs. To substitute larger or smaller eggs in recipes, visit the Basic Egg Facts page. Also available are reduced cholesterol eggs (sold in the shell), powdered eggs, and liquid pasteurized eggs (sold in cartons). Equivalents: 1 whole egg = 2 egg whites (to reduce fat; may make baked goods less tender) = 2 egg yolks (in sauces, custards, and cream fillings). One egg contains about one tablespoon of egg yolk and two tablespoons of egg white.
