### Notes
* Milk is an oil in water [[emulsion]], 90% water with sugars and proteins
* Globules of milk fat, a few microns across, are suspended
* Milk has about 4% fat
* Fat globules are surrounded by a membrane that keeps fat particles separated (like like a bunch of small balloons inside a large balloon)
* Fat globules, like balloons, are less dense than the water so they float to the top after a day of sitting
* Once the globules have risen, they create a layer on top of the rest of the milk which is the 35% milk fat and is the [[cream]]
