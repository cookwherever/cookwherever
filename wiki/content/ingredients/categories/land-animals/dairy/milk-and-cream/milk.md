You can buy it fresh, or as powdered milk, canned evaporated milk, or UHT milk packed in aseptic containers. Fresh is best for drinking and delicate desserts, the other kinds pick up an unpleasant caramelized flavor when they're heated for packaging. Acidophilus milk tastes much the same as ordinary milk, but it includes the beneficial acidophilus bacteria that are destroyed during pasteurization.

### Varieties
* skim milk or nonfat milk (0.5% fat), low-fat milk (2% fat), and whole milk (3.5% fat)

### Notes
* Milk is an oil in water [[emulsion]], 90% water with sugars and proteins
* Globules of milk fat, a few microns across, are suspended
* Milk has about 4% fat
* Fat globules are surrounded by a membrane that keeps fat particles separated (like like a bunch of small balloons inside a large balloon)
* Fat globules, like balloons, are less dense than the water so they float to the top after a day of sitting
* Once the globules have risen, they create a layer on top of the rest of the milk which is the 35% milk fat and is the [[cream]]

### Other Names
