goat's milk This comes with varying percentages of butterfat. You can buy it fresh, or as powdered milk, canned evaporated milk, or UHT milk packed in aseptic containers. Fresh is best for drinking and delicate desserts, the other kinds pick up an unpleasant caramelized flavor when they're heated for packaging. Substitutes: cow's milk (This is less expensive and milder-tasting, but harder to digest than goat's milk.) OR oat milk (This is more expensive and less nutritious, but a good all-purpose substitute for milk in cooking. This is a good choice for vegetarians who object to the animal exploitation involved in the production of goat's or cow's milk.) OR buttermilk (Especially good in pancakes or waffles. If using in baked goods, 1C milk = 1 C buttermilk - 2 teaspoons baking powder + 1/2 teaspoon baking soda) OR soy milk (This is more expensive and, unless fortified, less nutritious than goat's milk. It has a nutty flavor and turns beige when cooked. It works well in most baked goods, but it's a risky substitute in savory dishes.) OR rice milk (This is more expensive and, unless fortified, less nutritious. It's great for making desserts, but it's too sweet for savory dishes) OR almond milk (This is also more expensive and, unless fortified, less nutritious. It's very sweet, so use it in desserts only) OR water (This makes eggs creamier in scrambled eggs and gives breads a coarser texture and a lighter crust.)
