### Other Names
* yogurt
* yoghurt

This is milk that's cultured with bacteria to make it thick and tangy. Ready-made yogurts are made from whole milk (with up to 4% butterfat), lowfat milk (with up to 2% butterfat), and skim milk (with up to .5% butterfat). Health buffs prefer brands that contain active cultures, which help keep their intestines populated with friendly bacteria. Many brands are heat-treated to destroy these cultures and increase shelf life. Yogurt often comes with added flavorings and thickeners. "Light" flavored yogurts are made with artificial sweeteners to reduce calories. Lactaid makes a lactose-reduced yogurt, but many people with lactose intolerance can tolerate ordinary yogurt, especially brands that contains active yogurt cultures. Larger markets also carry yogurt made from soy milk and goat's milk, but these don't work well in delicate desserts. Organic yogurts also are available. To make your own: Add a tablespoon of plain yogurt (with active cultures) to milk and keep it at roughly 110Â° for several hours, then refrigerate. Where to find it: Dairy case of most markets

### Substitutes
* [[sour-cream]] (This is higher in fat and calories, but less likely to curdle if boiled with an acidic ingredient.)
* [[buttermilk]] (This substitution usually works well in baked goods, dressings, and sauces.)
* blend cottage cheese until smooth (not as tart)
* silky tofu (not as tart; doesn't work well in delicate desserts)

## Info
* 5000 BC Mesopotamia
* More shelf stable than milk
* Live bacteria 
* Pasteurize milk - kill bacteria to not have competition with yogurt bacteria
* 110 - 110 F needed for bacteria to do their thing
* Streptococcus Thermophilus and Lactobacillus Delbrueckii Subsp. Bulgaricus common bacteria used in yogurts in the US
* Different yogurts have different bacteria
* Bacteria interaction
	* Lactobacillus Delbrueckii Subsp. Bulgaricus creates amino acids
	* Streptococcus Thermophilus creates lactic acid
	* When PH drops to 5, Lactobacillus Delbrueckii Subsp. Bulgaricus also starts making lactic acid
* The more acidic the yogurt becomes, the milk proteins create a network that will trap water. The proteins [[coagulate]] and make a soft gel.
* Ultra pasteurized milk is ideal for a smooth and uniform consistency. It is heated up to 275 F for 5 seconds and then rapidly chilled.
* A [[starter]] can be store bought yogurt or yogurt you made previously.
* Strained [[whey-water]] can be used in buttermilk biscuits.
