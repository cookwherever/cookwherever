* Live bacteria 
* Pasteurize milk - kill bacteria to not have competition with yogurt bacteria
* 110 - 110 F needed for bacteria to do their thing
* Streptococcus Thermophilus and Lactobacillus Delbrueckii Subsp. Bulgaricus common bacteria used in yogurts in the US
* Different yogurts have different bacteria
* Bacteria interaction
	* Lactobacillus Delbrueckii Subsp. Bulgaricus creates amino acids
	* Streptococcus Thermophilus creates lactic acid
	* When PH drops to 5, Lactobacillus Delbrueckii Subsp. Bulgaricus also starts making lactic acid
* The more acidic the yogurt becomes, the milk proteins create a network that will trap water. The proteins [[coagulate]] and make a soft gel.
* Ultra pasteurized milk is ideal for a smooth and uniform consistency. It is heated up to 275 F for 5 seconds and then rapidly chilled.
* A [[starter]] can be store bought yogurt or yogurt you made previously.
* Strained [[whey-water]] can be used in buttermilk biscuits.
