pasteurized process cheese Shopping hints: Look for this in deli counters and in holiday gift packs. This cheese is a blend of fresh and aged cheeses, and it's pasteurized to stop the ripening process. This improves shelf life but impairs flavor. Nuts, fruits, and other seasoning are often added. Substitutes: pasteurized process cheese food (moister, lower in fat)
