### Notes
* Fat suspended in a watery medium (an [[emulsion]]) with the help of proteins to make a mesh network to hold it together
* Heat loosens proteins to melt the cheese
* Aged cheeses have water removed from them over time and their proteins clump together like interconnected grapes. When heated, the fat will drip out, but the clumped proteins will stay together
* Sodium citrate is a "melting salt" that can bind itself with some of the calcium ions in the cheese protein network. The result is an untangling of connected clusters of proteins which keeps the emulsion stable when melted. Oh yeah, an its chemical equation is literally: Na3C6H5O7
* Tartaric acid in white wine helps with melting
