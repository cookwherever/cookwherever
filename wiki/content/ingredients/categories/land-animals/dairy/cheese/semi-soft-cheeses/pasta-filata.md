pasta filata = spun curd cheeses = pulled curd cheeses = plastic curd cheeses = stretched curd cheeses These cheeses are stretched and pulled like taffy before being molded, which gives them a springy, elastic consistency. Unlike many cheeses, they stand up well to cooking. This category includes mozzarella, Provolone, Scamorza, string cheese, and Caciocavallo.
