queso enchilada = anejo enchilado = queso anejo This is a hard Mexican grating cheese that's coated with red chile paste. Substitutes: cotija (sharper tasting) OR Romano OR Parmesan OR nutritional yeast (This substitution works best if recipe calls for cheese to be sprinkled over a dish. Nutritional yeast is low in fat, high in protein and B vitamins, and it's not made with any animal products.)
