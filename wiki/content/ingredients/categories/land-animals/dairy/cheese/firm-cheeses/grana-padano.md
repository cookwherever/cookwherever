Grana Padano This is just like Parmesan, except that it's made in a different part of Italy. Substitutes: Parmesan OR Asiago OR Romano OR nutritional yeast (This substitution works best if recipe calls for cheese to be sprinkled over a dish. Nutritional yeast is low in fat, high in protein and B vitamins, and it's not made with any animal products.) OR oil-cured black olives (as a pizza topping) OR seasoned breadcrumbs (as a pizza topping)
