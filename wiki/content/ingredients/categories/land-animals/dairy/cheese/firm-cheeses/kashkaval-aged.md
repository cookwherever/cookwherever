Kashkaval (aged) = Kachkeval (aged) Don't confuse this with ordinary Kashkaval, which is a semi-firm cheese. Substitutes: Parmesan OR nutritional yeast (This substitution works best if recipe calls for cheese to be sprinkled over a dish. Nutritional yeast is low in fat, high in protein and B vitamins, and it's not made with any animal products.)
