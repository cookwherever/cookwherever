mimolette cheese = boule de Lille mee-moh-LET Notes: This French cheese is similar to Parmesan cheese, only it's a brilliant orange. Substitutes: Parmesan cheese Mizithra (aged) = Mytzithra (aged) Don't confuse this salty grating cheese with fresh Mizithra, which is similar to feta. This cheese is dry, crumbly, and very salty. Substitutes: ricotta salata OR Romano OR Parmesan OR nutritional yeast (This substitution works best if recipe calls for cheese to be sprinkled over a dish. Nutritional yeast is low in fat, high in protein and B vitamins, and it's not made with any animal products.) Parmesan cheese = Parmigiano Notes: This firm cheese is pungent and salty, and it's terrific grated on salads, pasta, or pizzas, or served simply with figs, pears, or crusty bread. The best parmesan is the Northern Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano, but less pricy domestic Parmesans are also well regarded. Substitutes: grana Padano OR Romano (higher in fat; sharper flavor) OR aged Asiago (saltier) OR Sapsago (low in fat) OR Swiss Sbrinz OR Fontina OR Monterey jack OR nutritional yeast (This substitution works best if recipe calls for cheese to be sprinkled over a dish. Nutritional yeast is low in fat, high in protein and B vitamins, and it's not made with any animal products.) OR "Soyco" grated parmesan (a soy-based cheese substitute) OR See the Parmesan Sprinkle recipe (made with yeast flakes and almonds) posted on www.vegweb.com. OR oil-cured black olives (as a pizza topping) OR seasoned breadcrumbs (as a pizza topping)
