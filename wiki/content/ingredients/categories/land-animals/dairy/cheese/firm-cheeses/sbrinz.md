Sbrinz = Swiss Sbrinz This hard Swiss cheese resembles Parmesan. Substitutes: Emmentaler (softer) OR Gruyere (softer) OR Parmesan OR Romano OR nutritional yeast (This substitution works best if recipe calls for cheese to be sprinkled over a dish. Nutritional yeast is low in fat, high in protein and B vitamins, and it's not made with any animal products.)
