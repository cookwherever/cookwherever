Boursin [boor-SAN] This creamy cheese from France is usually flavored with herbs, garlic or coarse ground pepper. It's mild and delicate, and goes well with fresh bread and dry white wine. Boursin is considered better than some other flavored spreadable cheeses, like Alouette or Rondel�, but none of these cheeses are well regarded by gourmets. Store Boursin in the refrigerator but bring it to room temperature before serving. Eat it within a few days of purchase. Substitutes: Rondel� (a cheaper domestic imitation) OR Alouette (also a cheaper domestic imitation) OR Mix together in a food processor using a steel blade: 8 ounces of cream cheese, 4 tablespoons butter, 1 teaspoon minced parsley, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic, 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper. Chill for several hours before serving. OR ch�vre frais
