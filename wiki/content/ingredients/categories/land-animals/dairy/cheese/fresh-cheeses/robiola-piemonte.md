robiola Piemonte roh-bee-OH-lah pia-MAWN-tay Notes: This creamy fresh cheese from the Piedmond region of Italy is often used for cooking, and it's great on pizza. It's also served as an antipasto along with olive oil and/or fresh herbs. Piedmont robiolas include Langhe Robiola = Robiola delle Langhe, Robiola di Roccaverano, Robiola di Murazzano, and Robiolina di Bosconero. These cheeses are hard to find in the U.S. Don't confuse this with robiola Lombardia, a soft cheese. Substitutes: equal parts ricotta and mascarpone OR ricotta OR mascarpone OR chevre OR Caprini
