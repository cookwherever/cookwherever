Appenzell = Appenzeller This is a creamy and pleasantly stinky cheese. Pronunciation: AP-en-zel Substitutes: Emmentaler OR Gruyère OR raclette OR Fontina Asiago (fresh) ah-zee-AH-go Notes: Don't confuse this with aged Asiago, which is a firm grating cheese. Substitutes: Provolone OR other semi-firm cheese Beaufort BOH-furt Notes: This semi-firm cheese is slightly sweet and has a nice texture. It's a great melting cheese, so it's often used in fondues. Substitutes: Emmenthal OR Gruyère OR Fontina OR Tomme OR Reblochon Caciotta = Casciotta kah-CHOH-tah Notes: This mild Italian cheese is made with a blend of sheep's milk and cow's milk cheese. Caerphilly Pronunciation: kar-FILL-ee Notes: This Welsh cow's milk cheese is crumbly and a good melter. Substitutes: Cheddar Cantal kahn-TAHL Notes: This French cheese is sweet when young but earthy and grassy when aged. It's a reliable party-pleaser--mild but complex. Substitutes: Cheddar OR Gruyère OR Monterey jack OR Lancashire Cheddar Notes: The curds of many English cheeses are "cheddared" or cut them into slabs and stacked to allow whey to drain off. Some cheddars have more lactose in them, making them "sharp" or acidic. Less sharp cheddars are often labeled "mild" or "medium." England supplies many fine Cheddars, as does Vermont and Tillamook, Oregon. Substitutes: Colby OR Cheshire OR American cheese OR "Tofu Rella" Amber (a soy-based cheese substitute; use in melted cheese dishes) OR nutritional yeast OR white miso OR cheese substitutes Cheshire CHESH-er Notes: Said to be England's oldest cheese, is a good cooking cheese. Blue Cheshire is a blue-veined version. Substitutes: Cheddar OR cheese substitutes
