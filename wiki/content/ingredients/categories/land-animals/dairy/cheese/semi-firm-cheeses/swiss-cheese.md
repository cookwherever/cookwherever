Swiss cheese = American Swiss cheese Notes: This popular cheese is an American knock-off of Switzerland's Emmentaler cheese. This difference is that our domestic version usually has smaller eyes (making it easier to slice) and is made from pasteurized milk. Emmentaler has a richer, nuttier flavor. Substitutes: Emmentaler OR Gruy√®re OR Jarlsberg OR raclette OR cheese substitutes
