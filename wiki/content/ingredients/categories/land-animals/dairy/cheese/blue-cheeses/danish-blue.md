Danish blue = Danablu Notes: Danish blue is rich and creamy, but it's considered inferior to Roquefort, Gorgonzola, or Stilton. Substitutes: Another blue cheese Fourme d'Ambert FOORM-dom-BARE Notes: The French claim to have been making this moist blue cheese since the time of the Ancient Romans. It's cheaper and milder than many blue cheeses. Substitutes: Saint Agur cheese OR Cambozola OR Cashel Blue OR Stilton OR Bleu d'Auverne OR Bleu de Gex Gorgonzola Pronunciation: gore-gun-ZOE-lah Notes: Italian Gorgonzolas are creamy and mild, while domestic versions are sharper and more crumbly. A Gorgonzola dolce (DOLE-chay) is young, creamy, and mild, while a Gorgonzola naturale = mountain Gorgonzola is aged until it's firmer and more pungent. Use within a few days after purchasing. For best flavor, serve at room temperature. Some Gorgonzola cheeses can be frozen successfully, others become crumbly (but still usable in salads). For best results, first cut the cheese into small (1/2 pound) chunks, and wrap each chunk in an airtight package. Thaw in the refrigerator, and use the cheese soon after it's thawed. Substitutes: Roquefort (has a less fatty texture) OR Stilton (much firmer) OR Saga Blue cheese Maytag Blue Notes: This American blue cheese is pungent and crumbly. Use it within a few days after purchasing. For best flavor, serve at room temperature. Substitutes: Roquefort Montbriac = Montbriac Rochebaron This French cow's milk cheese is a mild blue cheese that's soft and creamy like a Brie. It's coated with ash.
