sevruga caviar In recent years, over-fishing in the Caspian Sea has greatly depleted sturgeon populations. Please consider using caviar and roe from more abundant species until the Caspian Sea sturgeon populations can recover. Greenish-gray sevruga has the smallest eggs and strongest flavor of all the caviars. Because of this, it's cheaper than beluga or ossetra, but still quite good. If substituting an inferior caviar, consider perking it up with a splash of fresh lemon juice. Substitutes: paddlefish caviar OR hackleback caviar (black, not gray) OR ossetra caviar (This has larger grains, brown instead of gray, more subtle flavor. It also comes from Caspian Sea sturgeon.) OR beluga caviar (This is more expense, has still larger grains, and an even more subtle flavor. It comes from Caspian Sea sturgeon.) OR bowfin caviar (black, not gray) OR lumpfish roe (not as delicate)
