imperial caviar = golden oscietre = golden ossetra = shah's caviar = royal caviar In recent years, over-fishing in the Caspian Sea has greatly depleted sturgeon populations. Please consider using caviar and roe from more abundant species until the Caspian Sea sturgeon populations can recover. This greenish-gold caviar has very large grains and is very rare and pricey. Substitutes: ossetra caviar (also comes from Caspian Sea sturgeon) OR paddlefish caviar (gray, not brown) OR hackleback caviar (black, not brown) OR bowfin caviar (black, not brown) OR lumpfish roe (not as delicate)
