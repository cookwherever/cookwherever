caviar = sturgeon roe Caviar is known for its subtle, buttery flavor and high price. It should always be served cold. In recent years, over-fishing in the Caspian Sea has greatly depleted sturgeon populations. Please consider using caviar and roe from more abundant species until the Caspian Sea sturgeon populations can recover. Malossol, or lightly salted caviar, is considered to be the highest quality. Caviar that doesn't make the malossol grade is used to make pressed caviar = payusnaya. Fresh caviar is considered much better than the pasteurized version. If substituting an inferior caviar, consider perking it up with a splash of fresh lemon juice. Equivalents: 2 tablespoons = 1 ounce Varieties: (from highest to lowest price) imperial caviar, beluga caviar, ossetra caviar, and sevruga caviar. Substitutes: hackleback roe (This black roe comes from American sturgeon. It's very delicate yet relatively inexpensive.) OR paddlefish roe (This gray roe also comes from American sturgeon. It resembles sevruga caviar but it's a lot cheaper.) OR salmon roe (This has large orange eggs and a bolder flavor than caviar.) OR lumpfish roe (This is cheaper, but much saltier and not as delicate) OR bowfin roe (This black roe is cheaper, but not as delicate as caviar)
