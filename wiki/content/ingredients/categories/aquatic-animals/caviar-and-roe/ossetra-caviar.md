ossetra caviar = oscietre caviar = ocietra caviar = asetra caviar In recent years, over-fishing in the Caspian Sea has greatly depleted sturgeon populations. Please consider using caviar and roe from more abundant species until the Caspian Sea sturgeon populations can recover. Ossetra caviar is brown and more strongly flavored than beluga caviar. Don't confuse ordinary ossetra with the rare and expensive golden ossetra = imperial caviar. If substituting an inferior caviar, consider perking it up with a splash of fresh lemon juice. Substitutes: sevruga caviar (smaller grains, gray instead of brown, stronger flavor) OR beluga caviar (larger grains, more expensive, gray instead of brown, more subtle flavor) OR paddlefish caviar (gray, not brown) OR hackleback caviar (black, not brown) OR bowfin caviar (black, not brown) OR lumpfish roe (not as delicate)
