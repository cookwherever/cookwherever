paddlefish roe = grey pearl caviar Paddlefish swim in Southern rivers and they're relatives of sturgeons--the fish that produce the world's most expensive and exquisite caviars. Paddlefish roe is very similar to sevruga caviar, only it's cheaper. Since Caspian Sea sturgeon are rapidly becoming depleted from over-fishing, many people are turning to paddlefish roe as a substitute for caviar. Subsitutes: sevruga caviar (very similar, more expensive) OR beluga caviar (more expensive, larger grains, black instead of gray) OR hackleback roe (black, not gray) OR bowfin caviar (black, not gray)
