crayfish = crawfish = crawdad = ecrevisse = �crevisse Six pounds live crayfish = one pound peeled tails; 15 large crayfish = one pound Notes: Crayfish are very popular in Louisiana, where restaurants serve them on large platters along with bowls of melted butter. Buy live ones if you can; if not, large supermarkets sometimes stock frozen whole crayfish or crayfish tails. Get the whole crayfish if possible--most of the flavor resides in the shells. Allow one to two pounds per person. Substitutes: rock shrimp OR Dublin Bay prawns (larger) OR shrimp OR spiny lobster OR lobster OR walleye pike OR sheepshead OR crab
