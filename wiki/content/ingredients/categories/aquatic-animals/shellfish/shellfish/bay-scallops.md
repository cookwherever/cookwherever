bay scallops = Chinese scallops These are easier to find in the East than in the West. Frozen scallops are a good substitute for fresh. Substitutes: calico scallop (not as sweet) OR sea scallop (This is larger than the bay scallop, and less sweet and delicate. Consider cutting it into bite-size pieces before cooking.) OR shark meat (Note: Unscrupulous restaurants sometimes palm off shark meat as scallops to unsuspecting customers.) OR cod cheeks OR skate See also: scallops
