stuffing = dressing = stuffing croutons This is usually put inside a whole turkey to absorb flavorful juices while the bird roasts, but it can also be baked in a casserole dish. It's usually made of small bread cubes or shredded pieces of bread that have been dried. Commercial stuffing is convenient, but not as fresh-tasting as homemade stuffing. To make your own: Slice bread into 1/4" cubes, place them on a baking sheet, and bake in a 300ï¿½ oven until they're crisp and dry. Substitutes: breadcrumbs (coarse) OR croutons OR cornbread crumbs (softer consistency) OR rice OR potatoes
