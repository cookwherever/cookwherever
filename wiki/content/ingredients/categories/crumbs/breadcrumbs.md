breadcrumbs = bread crumbs 1 cup fine dry breadcrumbs = 4 slices bread; 1 cup fresh breadcrumbs = 3 slices bread. Notes: These are used for breading foods, topping casseroles, stuffing poultry, thickening stews, and adding inexpensive bulk to meatloaves, hamburgers, and fish cakes. Dry breadcrumbs are made from very dry bread, and make for a crispy, crunchy coating for fried foods. The bread that's used to make soft or fresh bread crumbs isn't as dry, so the crumbs produce a softer coating, crust, or stuffing. Almost any bread can be used to make breadcrumbs, but crusty French or Italian bread works especially well. To make your own: Use stale (but not moldy) bread, or bake bread slices in a slow oven (200ï¿½) until slightly dry (for fresh bread crumbs) or very dry (for dry bread crumbs), and allow to cool. Process the slices in a food processor, using a steel blade to make coarse crumbs, or a grating blade to make fine crumbs. Season with salt, herbs, garlic powder, onion powder, and/or lemon zest if you wish. Substitutes: panko (This is especially good with seafood; it has larger crumbs, stays crisp longer, and is considered better than ordinary bread crumbs.) OR cracker crumbs (3/4 cup cracker crumbs = 1 cup bread crumbs) OR croutons (crushed) OR stuffing (crushed) OR cornflake crumbs OR matzo meal OR other unsweetened cereal flakes OR potato flakes OR rice cakes (crushed) OR high-fiber cereal (as a nutritious topping or filler)
