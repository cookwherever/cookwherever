panko = panko bread crumbs = panko breadcrumbs = Japanese bread crumbs = Japanese breadcrumbs = Japanese style breadcrumbs = Japanese style bread crumbs PAN-koh Notes: Panko breadcrumbs have a coarser texture than ordinary breadcrumbs, and they make for a much lighter and crunchier casserole topping and coating for deep-fried foods. They're especially good for breading seafood. Tan-colored panko is made from the whole loaf, white panko from bread with the crusts cut off. Look for both kinds in the Asian foods section of larger supermarkets. Substitutes: breadcrumbs (not as coarse, doesn't stay crisp as long) OR cracker meal OR melba toast (crushed)
