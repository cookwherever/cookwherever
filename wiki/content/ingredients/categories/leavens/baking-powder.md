### Notes
- Composed of baking soda, powered acid, and a starch
	- Starch will absorb moisture to avoid the acid and base from reacting prematurely
- Releases carbon dioxide gas by just adding water
- "double-acting"
	- First reaction happens when mixing water
	- Second reaction happens when heated
- TODO: Baking powder is a mixture of one or more acidic salts and baking soda, an alkali. These two compounds react when they get wet and release carbon dioxide gas bubbles. These, in turn, cause baked goods to rise. Baking powder is perishable. To test a batch, add 1 teaspoon to 1/4 cup hot water. If it doesn't bubble, throw it out.
