lard = pork lard Notes: Lard is rendered pork fat. It's high in saturated fat, and quite bad for you. Still, it's the fat of choice for making flaky pie crusts, though it's not as flavorful as butter. Some pastry chefs combine butter with lard to achieve a balance of flavor and flakiness. Lard is also used for frying since it can reach high temperatures without smoking. See also the entries for lard leaves and lardo. To make your own: Bring 1 pound cut-up pork fat plus 3/4 cup water to a boil and then simmer for 20 minutes. Strain. Substitutes: butter (In baked goods, 5 tablespoons butter = 4 tablespoons lard. Pastry made with butter instead of lard may be less tender and flaky.) OR margarine (In baked goods, 5 tablespoons margarine = 4 tablespoons lard. Pastry made with margarine instead of lard may be less tender and flaky.) OR bacon fat (For frying.) OR shortening OR vegetable oil (Vegetable oil is good for frying, and more healthful than lard.) See also: fat (for low-fat or no-fat substitutions)
