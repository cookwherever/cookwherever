### Notes
* [[cream]] is [[churnning|churned]] and creates butter (large clump of fat with some water droplets suspended) and buttermlilk (remaining liquid from the process of churning).
* Butter in America must be at least 80% butter fat. Premium butters/European butters can be as high as 86%. Remaining percent is mostly water (13%-19%) and a small percent of milk solids (~1% of proteins, sugars, vitamins, and minerals)
* Butter between 34 and 40° F is firm
	* Flakiness in baked goods is created with firm butter. 
	* As the butter melts in the oven, the fat melts and releases the suspended water as steam which puffs up and separates the different layers.
* Butter between 60 and 69° F is softened butter
	* Ideal temperature is 67° F for creaming with sugar
	* Whipping sugar into softened butter introduces many air bubbles that are suspended in the milk fat which will expand when placed into the oven.
	* If the butter is too cold, bubbles can't be incorporated. Too warm, the bubbles collapse.
* Butter between 70 and 89° F is good for spreading
* Butter 90° F melts as the milk fat reaches its melting point
* Butter 212° F evaporates water
* Mid 200°s F, the butter [[ingredients/concepts/chemistry/browning/browning|browns]] from the proteins 
* Taking milk fat from melted butter makes [[clarified-butter]]
