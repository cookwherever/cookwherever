This is a delicious solid fat churned from milk. It's used in baking, frying, and as a spread on toast and muffins. Recipes that call for butter in most better cookbooks are referring to unsalted butter = sweet cream butter = sweet butter. Salted butter doesn't spoil as readily (the salt serves as a preservative). See also the entries for whipped butter and European-style butter.

### Equivalents
1 pound = 2 cups = 4 sticks. 1 stick = 8 tablespoons. 1 stick salted butter = 1 stick unsalted butter + 3/8 teaspoon salt. (The salt content of salted butter can vary between brands.) To make your own: In a blender or food processor, mix one cup chilled whipping cream for a few minutes until butter forms. Pour off excess liquid (buttermilk) and wash butter repeatedly with cold water until rinse water is clear.

### Substitutions
* margarine (This has an inferior flavor, makes bread crusts tougher and cookies softer, and may make cookies more difficult to shape. Avoid using it in flaky pastries.)
* shortening (This has an inferior flavor, and compared to butter it makes cookies crunchier and breads crusts softer.
* lard (This has an inferior flavor, but it makes flakier pastries than butter. Some cooks mix lard with butter to strike a balance between flavor and flakiness. Substitute four parts lard for every five parts butter called for in recipe.)
* See also: fat (for low-fat or no-fat substitutions)

### Notes
* [[cream]] is [[churnning|churned]] and creates butter (large clump of fat with some water droplets suspended) and buttermlilk (remaining liquid from the process of churning).
* Butter in America must be at least 80% butter fat. Premium butters/European butters can be as high as 86%. Remaining percent is mostly water (13%-19%) and a small percent of milk solids (~1% of proteins, sugars, vitamins, and minerals)
* Butter between 34 and 40° F is firm
	* Flakiness in baked goods is created with firm butter. 
	* As the butter melts in the oven, the fat melts and releases the suspended water as steam which puffs up and separates the different layers.
* Butter between 60 and 69° F is softened butter
	* Ideal temperature is 67° F for creaming with sugar
	* Whipping sugar into softened butter introduces many air bubbles that are suspended in the milk fat which will expand when placed into the oven.
	* If the butter is too cold, bubbles can't be incorporated. Too warm, the bubbles collapse.
* Butter between 70 and 89° F is good for spreading
* Butter 90° F melts as the milk fat reaches its melting point
* Butter 212° F evaporates water
* Mid 200°s F, the butter [[ingredients/concepts/chemistry/browning/browning|browns]] from the proteins 
* Taking milk fat from melted butter makes [[clarified-butter]]
