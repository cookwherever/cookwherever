margarine = oleomargarine In addition to regular margarine, supermarkets usually carry diet margarine = lite margarine (with about half the fat and more water and air), soft margarine, whipped margarine (containing up to 50% air). These diet margarines make wonderful spreads, but they shouldn't be substituted for regular margarine in baked goods. For more information, visit the Illinois Cooperative Extension Service's Lite Margarine--Substitution for Baking page. Substitutes: butter (butter has a better flavor but has cholesterol, makes crisper cookies, crisper bread crusts) OR shortening + pinch of salt (makes crunchier cookies, softer bread crusts, has inferior taste) OR lard (especially for making pastry or for frying) See also: fat (for low-fat or no-fat substitutions)
