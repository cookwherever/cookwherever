palm oil = dende oil (dend� oil) Notes: This bright orange palm oil is a staple in Brazilian cuisine, but very high in saturated fat. Substitutes: annatto oil (Not as flavorful, but it has a similar color and is lower in saturated fat.) OR peanut oil (This is lower in saturated fat, but it lacks dend� oil's distinctive color. To compensate, add ground annatto seeds to the oil.)
