sesame oil (includes light sesame oil and stronger dark sesame oil) Substitutes: Cook 1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds plus one cup sunflower seed oil (or other vegetable oil) for two minutes, mix well in a blender, then let stand for at least two hours, then strain out the seeds with cheesecloth or towel. (This is adapted from a recipe given in Jennifer Brennan's excellent book, The Cuisines of Asia. See my sources.) Notes: Sesame oil has a low smoke point and is relatively expensive, so it's not good for frying.
