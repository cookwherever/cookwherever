This is butter without the milk solids, so it doesn't go rancid or smoke when heated to a high temperature. Look for jars of it in Indian markets. To make your own: Melt butter using very low heat until a white deposit forms on the bottom of the pan, then strain and discard milky residue. It's best to refrigerate this in case some of the milk solids remain.

### Substitutes
* canola oil (more healthful)
* other vegetable oil (Not as flavorful, but the fat is unsaturated.)
* butter (downside: foods fried in unclarified butter are more likely to overbrown)
* cooking spray (for greasing pans)

### Notes
* Can be heated to 400Â° F before smoking

### Other Names

* clarified butter
* drawn butter
* AMF
* anhydrous milkfat
* butter oil
* ghee (made from browning milk solids first before straining milk fat, creates nuttier flavor)

### Varieties

* [[fats]]
