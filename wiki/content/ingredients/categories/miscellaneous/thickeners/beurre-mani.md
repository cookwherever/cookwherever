beurre mani� = beurre manie = kneaded butter BARE mahn-YAY Notes: This flour-butter mixture is used to correct overly thin sauces at the last minute. To make it, blend equal weights of butter and flour, then knead them together. After you whisk it into a sauce, let it cook for no more than a minute or two, since sauces thickened with flour pick up a starchy taste after they've cooked for a few minutes. Substitutes: roux (This is another flour-butter thickener, but the sauce should cook for at least 30 minutes to rid itself of the flour's starchy flavor.) OR tapioca starch (This also works quickly, and it's a good choice for correcting sauces at the last minute.)
