Instant Clearjel� This is a modified cornstarch that professional bakers sometimes use to thicken pie fillings. It has several advantages over ordinary cornstarch. Instant ClearJel� thickens without cooking, works well with acidic ingredients, tolerates high temperatures, is freezer-stable, and doesn't cause pie fillings to "weep" during storage. Don't use Instant ClearJel� for canning--it tends to break down. Substitutes: ClearJel� (not freezer-stable) OR tapioca starch OR arrowroot starch OR cornstarch
