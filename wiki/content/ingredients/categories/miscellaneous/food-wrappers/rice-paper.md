rice paper = spring roll wrappers = Vietnamese rice paper = banh trang wrappers These thin, fragile sheets are used to make spring rolls, but they also make good all-purpose wrappers, baking pan liners, and even lasagne noodles. The sheets are brittle, so you need to moisten them with water before wrapping foods in them. Keep them moist while you work with them by covering the stack with a damp towel. Rice paper doesn't need to be cooked, but it's sturdy enough to be steamed or deep-fried. Look for it in Asian markets. It can be stored in a cool, dark place for many months. Substitutes: phyllo dough (moisten and seal with peanut oil or melted butter) OR egg roll wrappers (These need to be cooked, and they're smaller and thicker than rice paper. When fried, egg roll wrappers aren't as tender and crisp as spring roll wrappers.) OR yufka (moisten and seal with peanut oil or melted butter) OR puff pastry (Roll it thin before using.)
