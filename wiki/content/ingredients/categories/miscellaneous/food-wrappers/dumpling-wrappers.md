dumpling wrappers = dumpling skins = shao mai skins = shu mai skins = siu mai skins = su my wrappers = shiu mai wrappers These thin round wrappers are used to make the delicate dumplings that are so popular at dim sum restaurants. They're made to be stuffed and steamed, but they're not sturdy enough to be fried. While assembling the dumplings, keep the stack of wrappers moist by covering them with a damp towel. You can seal the dumplings with a "glue" made with cornstarch and water. Look for fresh or frozen wrappers in Asian markets. Store them in the refrigerator or freezer, but let them come to room temperature before using. Substitutes: wonton skins (These are thicker. Trim off square corners before using.) OR egg roll wrappers (These are thicker. Cut into quarters and trim off square corners before using.) OR pasta sheet
