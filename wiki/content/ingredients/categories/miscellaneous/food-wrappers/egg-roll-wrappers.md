egg roll wrappers = egg roll skins = eggroll wrappers = eggroll skins The Chinese use these dough squares to make deep-fried egg rolls. While assembling the egg rolls, keep the stack of wrappers moist by covering them with a damp towel. You can seal the rolls with a "glue" made with cornstarch and water. Look for fresh wrappers in Asian markets and many supermarkets. Store them in the refrigerator or freezer, but let them come to room temperature before using. Substitutes: rice paper (larger and thinner; yields a crispier roll) OR phyllo (Bake the eggroll instead of frying it.) OR pasta sheet
