macadamia nut = Queensland nut = Australian nut mack-uh-DAY-me-uh Notes: These rich and creamy nuts hail from Hawaii and Australia, where they're eaten as snacks, or incorporated into cookies or other desserts. They're hard to crack open and tricky to roast, so they're almost always sold shelled and roasted in vacuum-pack containers. After you open these containers, you should store any uneaten nuts in the freezer or refrigerator, since they're high in fat and therefore prone to rancidity. If you want to roast your own macadamia nuts, put them in 275ï¿½ oven for about 15 minutes. Substitutes: Brazil nut (stronger flavor, 3 times as large) OR pecans OR walnuts OR almonds OR cashews
