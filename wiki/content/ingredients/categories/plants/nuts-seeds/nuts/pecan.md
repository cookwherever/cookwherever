pecan pih-CAHN OR pih-CAN Equivalents: 1 pound in the shell = 1/2 pound shelled = 2 cups shelled Notes: This North American nut is like a walnut, only sweeter and milder. It's used widely in the South to make pralines, pecan pie, ice cream, and nut breads. They're high in fat, so it's best to store shelled pecans in the refrigerator or freezer to prevent them from turning rancid. To roast, put shelled pecans on a baking pan and in bake them in a 325ï¿½ oven, stirring occasionally, until they're slightly golden, about ten minutes. Substitutes: walnuts OR hickory nuts (similar, but harder to shell)
