Brazil nut = para nut = cream nut 2 pounds unshelled = 1 pound shelled Notes: These nuts come from the Amazonian rainforest, and they're rich in protein, omega-3 fatty acid, and calcium. They're prone to rancidity, so store them in the refrigerator or freezer if you plan to keep them for awhile. It's easier to shell them if you first heat them in a 350ï¿½ oven for about 15 minutes. Substitutes: macadamia nuts (use 3 times as many) OR paradise nut OR almonds OR pecans
