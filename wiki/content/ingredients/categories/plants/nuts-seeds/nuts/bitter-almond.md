bitter almond Unprocessed bitter almonds have a more intense flavor than ordinary almonds, but they aren't available in the United States since they're mildly toxic if eaten raw. Instead, they're processed and used to make oil of bitter almonds, almond extract, almond liqueurs, and orgeat syrup. This name is often used (incorrectly) for the Chinese almond. Substitutes: Chinese almonds (Warning: Cook these before eating to remove toxins.) OR oil of bitter almonds (1 drop = 6 bitter almonds) OR almonds plus a few drops of almond extract OR almonds plus some amaretto liqueur (not as flavorful, more oily)
