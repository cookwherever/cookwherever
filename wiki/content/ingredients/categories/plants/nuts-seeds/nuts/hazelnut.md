hazelnut = filbert = cobnut Notes: Hazelnuts have a crunchy texture and an appealing flavor that goes especially well with chocolate. Unshelled nuts show up in the produce department of larger supermarkets in the fall and winter. Shelled nuts are available year-round near the baking supplies. Before you use them, toast shelled hazelnuts in a 325ï¿½ oven for ten to fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally. As soon a you take them from the oven, rub the nuts vigorously with a towel to remove their bitter brown skins. Substitutes: beechnuts OR almonds OR walnuts OR pecans OR Brazil nuts OR macadamia nuts
