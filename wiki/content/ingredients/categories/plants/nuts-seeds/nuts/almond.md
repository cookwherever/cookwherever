almond = sweet almond Equivalents: 3 ounces whole almonds = 1/2 cup = 65 almonds Notes: Almonds have a crunchy texture and a rich, delicate flavor that's especially good in desserts, like candy, ice cream, tortes, and coffee cake. To intensify their flavor, toast them on a baking pan in a 325ï¿½ degree oven, stirring occasionally, until they're golden (about 15 minutes for whole almonds). You can buy almonds shelled or unshelled, blanched, sliced, slivered, ground, or chopped. Substitutes: hazelnuts (for baking) OR Brazil nuts OR cashews OR pistachios (unsalted)
