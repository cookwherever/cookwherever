pumpkin seeds Pumpkin seeds are terrific snacks. Unlike sunflower seeds, they're usually eaten whole, though hulled pumpkin seeds, called pepitas, are commonly used in Mexican dishes. To roast fresh pumpkin seeds, wash them and blot them dry, then toss them with salt and melted butter or margarine and bake on a cookie sheet in a 325� oven for about 15 minutes. To dry fresh seeds, wash and blot them dry as before, but bake them in a warm (150�) oven for 1 to 2 hours. Substitutes: squash seeds OR sesame seeds OR sunflower seeds
