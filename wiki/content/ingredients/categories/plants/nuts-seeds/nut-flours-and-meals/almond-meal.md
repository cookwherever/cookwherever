almond meal = ground almonds Notes: Specialty stores carry this, but you can get it for less at Middle Eastern markets. To make your own: Grind blanched almonds in a nut mill until the meal has the consistency of cornmeal. You can also use a food processor fitted with a steel blade to do this, but it's hard to keep the nut meal from turning into nut butter. It helps to freeze the nuts before grinding, to use the pulse setting on the processor, and to add any sugar in the recipe to the nuts to help absorb the oils. Store nut meals in the refrigerator or freezer, and use them soon after you buy or make them. (1/4 pound whole nuts yields about 1 cup nut meal.) Substitutes: almond flour (This makes baked goods drier and gives them a finer, denser texture.)
