peanut powder Indian cooks use this to thicken their curries. To make your own: Roast and skin peanuts, then grind in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. It's tricky to do this, since over-mixing will yield nut butter. It helps to work with just a small batch of nuts at a time, and to use the pulse setting. (1/4 pound whole nuts yields about 1 cup nut meal.)
