apricot Like other stone fruit, apricots are sweetest--and most prone to bruising--when they're allowed to ripen on the tree. But unless you can pick your own, you'll probably have to make do with the slightly underripe, more durable apricots sold in markets. Allow them to soften at room temperature for a few days before eating them. They're best in the summer. Substitutes: apriums OR pluots OR peaches OR nectarines aprium Notes: This is an apricot/plum cross, with apricot dominating. Substitutes: pluots OR apricots OR plums
