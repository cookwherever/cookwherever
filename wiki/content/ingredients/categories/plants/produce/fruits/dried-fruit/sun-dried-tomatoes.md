sun-dried tomatoes = dried tomatoes Notes: Dried tomatoes have a richer, more concentrated flavor than ordinary tomatoes. They're great for snacking, or tossing in salads or sauces or on pizzas. Dried tomatoes usually come either dry or packed in oil. If they're hard and dry, steep them in boiling water for about 5 minutes before using them. Substitutes: tomato paste (in sauces)
