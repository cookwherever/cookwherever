feijoa = feijoda = pineapple guava feh-JO-uh Notes: To eat feijoas, just cut them in half and scoop out the pulp with a spoon. They also make terrific preserves and syrups. Look for them in large supermarkets. If they're hard when you buy them, allow them to ripen at room temperature until they give a bit when you squeeze them, then store them in the refrigerator. Substitutes: kiwi fruit OR pineapple OR strawberries OR guava
