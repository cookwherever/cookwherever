star fruit = starfruit = carambola = five-angled fruit = five corners = Chinese star fruit = tree melon Star fruit have a clean, crisp texture, and they make terrific star-shaped garnishes when sliced. They're also easy to use, since they don't need to be peeled or seeded, and they're slow to discolor. Some varieties are sweet, some are sour. Try to avoid ones that have brown spots or streaks. Substitutes: melons OR lemon slices (as garnish)
