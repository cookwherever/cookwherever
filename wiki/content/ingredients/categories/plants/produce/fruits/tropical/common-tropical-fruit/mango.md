mango Equivalents: The pulp from one large mango will yield one cup of pur�e. Notes: It's always a challenge to eat a mango. The pulp clings desperately to both peel and seed, and it usually turns into a mushy mess by the time you free it. Despite this, the mango is one of the most popular fruits in the world. It's sweet and juicy, and it has a wonderful, distinctive flavor. Select richly colored, firm mangoes, then let them ripen at home for a few days. Frozen mangoes are good substitutes for fresh. Substitutes: peaches OR nectarines OR papayas
