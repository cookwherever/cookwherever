kiwano = kiwano melon = horned melon = African horned cucumber = African horned melon = English tomato = hedged gourd = jelly melon = melano kee-WAH-noh Notes: This melon has a gorgeous orange rind with spikes--poke a stick in it and you'd have a medieval mace for a Halloween costume. The yellow-green flesh has the consistency of jello, and tastes a bit like cucumbers. Substitutes: cucumber (the flesh lacks the brilliant chartreuse color of the kiwano's flesh.) OR other melon
