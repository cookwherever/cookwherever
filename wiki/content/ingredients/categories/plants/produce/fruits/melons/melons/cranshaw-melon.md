Cranshaw melon = Crenshaw melon This large, popular melon is a cross between the Persian and Casaba melons. The rinds come in two colors: yellow and creamy white. The yellow ones taste better. You can buy Cranshaws while they're still a little underripe and let them sit on the counter for a few days. When fully ripe, a Cranshaw will be fragrant and yield slightly to gentle pressure at its blossom end. They're best in the fall. Substitutes: casaba melon OR Persian melon OR Sharlyn melon OR Spanish melon OR cantaloupe OR honeydew melon
