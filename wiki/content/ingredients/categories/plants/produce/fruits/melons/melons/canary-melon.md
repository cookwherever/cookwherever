Canary melon = Juan Canary melon These tend to vary in quality, so unless you're good at selecting melons, stick with more idiot-proof varieties like the honeydew or cantaloupe. Canaries should, at a minimum, have bright yellow rinds. They're in season in the fall. Substitutes: honeydew OR cantaloupe
