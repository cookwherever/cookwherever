Santa Claus melon = Christmas melon This is distinguished mostly by its long shelf life--you can store an uncut Santa Claus melon for several months. They have thick rinds, so don't bother smelling them for ripeness--they don't give off much of an aroma. Substitutes: honeydew (better flavor) OR cantaloupe (better flavor) OR casaba melons (These also have a long shelf life.)
