cranberry = bounceberry These tart berries are traditionally used to makes sauces and garnishes for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. It's best to buy them at their peak in October and November, and freeze any that you don't use right away. Substitutes: lingonberry (smaller, better flavor) OR carissa (especially for jellies) OR rhubarb
