blackberry = bramble Notes: These would be excellent berries were it not for their rather large seeds. They're still great for eating out of hand, but cooks often strain out the seeds when making pies and preserves. Select berries that are free of mold, and as black as possible. They arrive in markets in the summer. Substitutes: loganberry OR boysenberry OR mulberry (larger, more fragile) OR raspberry OR youngberry OR olallieberry OR dewberry OR red currant black currant = cassis KER-unt Notes: These are too tart to eat out of hand, but they're often used to make syrups, preserves, and the liqueur cassis. Frozen are a good substitute for fresh. Substitutes: elderberries OR blueberries OR red currants OR gooseberries
