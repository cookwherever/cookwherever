kiwi fruit = kiwi = kiwifruit = Chinese gooseberry = monkey peach = yang-tao Pronunciation: KEE-wee Notes: This small, oblong fruit is has fuzzy brown skin and beautiful green flesh dotted with edible black seeds. It tastes like a cross between gooseberries and strawberries. It's very versatile--you can eat it as a snack, blend it into sauces or sorbets, or peel and slice it as a garnish. It also contains an enzyme that tenderizes meat. Select kiwis that are hard, allowing them to ripen at room temperature for a few days. Substitutes: pitaya (very similar, but sweeter) OR gooseberry (much smaller berries) OR strawberry OR papaya (as meat tenderizer) OR pear (different flavor)
