raspberry It's a real challenge to get these hollow, fragile berries to consumers before they spoil, so you'll have to pay a high price for those that make it. Many don't, so check them carefully for mildew before you buy them. A good alternative is to buy them frozen. Substitutes: loganberry OR strawberry OR blackberry OR boysenberry OR olallieberry OR youngberry OR dewberry OR thimbleberry OR carissa (especially for preserves)
