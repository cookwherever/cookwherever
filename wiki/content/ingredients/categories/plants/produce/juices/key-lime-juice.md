key lime juice = Mexican lime juice Freshly squeezed lime juice is vastly superior to what you'll find in bottles. Key limes and bottled key lime juice are widely available in the Southeast, and in specialty markets elsewhere. Liquor stores sometimes carry Rose's lime juice, which is sweetened key lime juice. Substitutes: regular (Persian) lime juice (This is less potent, so use more. Some cooks prefer freshly squeezed Persian limes over bottled key lime juice for key lime pies.) OR passion fruit juice (This has a different flavor, but works well in key lime pie recipes.) OR calamondin juice (Also works well in key lime pies) OR Rose's lime juice (this is sweetened key lime juice)
