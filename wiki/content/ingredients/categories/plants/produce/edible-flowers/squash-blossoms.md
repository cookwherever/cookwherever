squash blossoms = squash flowers = flor de calabaza These make exquisite garnishes, but they can also be stuffed with fillings and fried, or else sautï¿½ed very briefly and put into omelettes or quesadillas. The best source of the blossoms is a garden, but non-gardeners can sometimes find them in farmers' markets or specialty markets. They don't store well, so try to use the blossoms soon after you get them.
