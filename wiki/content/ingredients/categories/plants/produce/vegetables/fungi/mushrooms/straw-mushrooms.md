straw mushrooms = paddy straw mushrooms Notes: These are a common ingredient in Chinese stir-fries. They're hard to find fresh, but canned straw mushrooms work well and are sold in many supermarkets. Better yet, but harder to find, are dried straw mushrooms, which have a more intense flavor than canned. Substitutes: enoki mushrooms OR white mushrooms,
