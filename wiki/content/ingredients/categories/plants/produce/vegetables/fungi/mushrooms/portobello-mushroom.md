portobello mushroom = portabello mushroom = giant cremini These are just large cremini mushrooms, and their size (about the same as a hamburger patty) makes them perfect for grilling or roasting. They're also more flavorful than younger, smaller creminis. Substitutes: cremini (smaller) OR matsutake (for grilling) OR porcini (for grilling)
