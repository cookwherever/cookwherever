shiitake mushroom = shitake mushroom = black forest mushroom = black mushroom = black winter mushroom = brown oak mushroom = Chinese black mushroom = Oriental black mushroom = forest mushroom = golden oak mushroom = donko Equivalents: 1 pound = 3 ounces dried. Pronunciation: she-TAH-kay Plural: shiitake Notes: Though shiitake mushrooms are now cultivated, they have the earthiness and flavor of wild mushrooms. They're large and meaty, and they work well in stir-fries, soups, and side dishes, or as a meat substitute. Dried shiitakes are excellent, and often preferable to fresh due to their more intense flavor. Soak them in water for about thirty minutes to reconstitute them, then use the water they soaked in to enhance your sauce. Substitutes: crimini mushrooms OR enoki mushrooms OR straw mushrooms OR chanterelles OR porcini mushrooms OR white mushrooms OR oyster mushrooms
