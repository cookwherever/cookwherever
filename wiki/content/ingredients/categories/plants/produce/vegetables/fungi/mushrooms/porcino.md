porcino = cepe = cep = bolete = king bolete = borowik = Polish mushroom = steinpilze = stensopp porcini singular: pore-CHEE-noh; plural: pore-CHEE-nee Equivalents: One pound fresh = 3 ounces dried Notes: Porcini mushrooms are well appreciated in Europe for their meaty texture and interesting flavor. If you can find them fresh, pick the largest caps you can find (or afford). Just wipe them clean before using; if you wash them, they'll soak up the water like a sponge. Dried porcini are also excellent. Substitutes: hedgehog OR chanterelle (fruitier flavor) OR portobello OR oyster mushrooms OR truffles
