okara = unohana = kirazu oh-KAH-rah Notes: This is the ivory pulp that's left over after the soy milk is squeezed from soybeans. It's moist and crumbly, full of protein and fiber, and about as flavorful as a wad of paper towels. Look for it in the produce section of Japanese markets. Substitutes: tofu (First reduce the moisture content by draining it in a colander overnight, with a weight pressing down on it.),
