extra-firm tofu This isn't as moist as firm tofu, so it holds its shape better and absorb more flavors. Store tofu in the refrigerator, changing the water daily, and use it within a week. Freezing it will make it chewier and give it a meatier texture. Look for cakes of it in plastic tubs in the refrigerated sections of supermarkets and health food stores. Substitutes: firm tofu (Before using, wrap it in cheesecloth and put a weight on it to press out some of the liquid) OR pressed tofu OR atsuage
