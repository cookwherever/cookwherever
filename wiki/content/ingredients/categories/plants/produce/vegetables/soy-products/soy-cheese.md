soy cheese Made from soy milk, soy cheese is a boon to those who eschew dairy products. There are many varieties, including those which mimic cheddar, Parmesan, mozzarella, jack, and Swiss. Most brands have a mild, ho-hum flavor and a dry texture. Except for the low-fat varieties, most of them melt fairly well. Substitutes: cheese OR nutritional yeast
