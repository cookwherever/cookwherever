yuba = uba = bean curd skins = soy milk skins = bean curd sheets This is the sweet, protein-rich skin that forms on warm soymilk as it cools. Japanese and Chinese cooks like to add it to soups or use it as wrappers, and when it's deep-fat fried, it makes a fairly realistic "skin" for a mock holiday turkey. You can buy very thin fresh sheets of it (called nama yuba) in Kyoto, Japan, and thicker round sheets that look like fruit leather in some Chinese markets. Elsewhere, you'll have to get it dried or frozen. Dried yuba comes as sheets, rolls, knots, and many other forms. It needs to be reconstituted with water before you can use it, unless you're planning to add it to a soup. Substitutes: bean stick
