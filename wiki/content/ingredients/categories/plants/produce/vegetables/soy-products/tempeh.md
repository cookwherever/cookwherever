tempeh = tempe TEM-pay OR tem-PAY Notes: This Indonesian meat substitute is made from soybeans and other grains that have been injected with a mold and allowed to ferment. It's rich in protein and fiber and has a chewy texture and salty, nutty flavor. Before using it, steam or simmer it for about twenty minutes. Then use it just like tofu or meat--either by marinating it and grilling or by crumbling it into pieces and frying them. Look for tempeh among the frozen foods in supermarkets or in health food stores. It will keep in the freezer for a few months, or in the refrigerator for about a week. Substitutes: tofu (This isn't as nutritious, chewy, or flavorful as tempeh) OR hamburger OR TVP OR seitan,
