curly endive = chicory = chicory endive = curly chicory = fris�e = frisee = frise You can use this crisp, bitter green in salads or cook it as a side dish. The outer leaves are green and somewhat bitter; the pale inner leaves are more tender and mild. Don't confuse this with Belgian endive, which the British call chicory and the French call endive. Substitutes: escarole (milder flavor, different texture) OR radicchio OR dandelion greens OR mustard greens dandelions = dandelion greens Dandelions have a somewhat bitter flavor, which Europeans appreciate more than Americans. Older dandelion greens should be cooked; younger ones can be cooked or served raw as a salad green. They're available year-round, but they're best in the spring. Substitutes: watercress (not as bitter) OR curly endive OR escarole OR arugula OR collard greens (if cooked) endigia = red endive This crunchy new French variety blends sweet and bitter flavors. Substitutes: Belgian endive OR radicchio
