dandelions = dandelion greens Dandelions have a somewhat bitter flavor, which Europeans appreciate more than Americans. Older dandelion greens should be cooked; younger ones can be cooked or served raw as a salad green. They're available year-round, but they're best in the spring. Substitutes: watercress (not as bitter) OR curly endive OR escarole OR arugula OR collard greens (if cooked)
