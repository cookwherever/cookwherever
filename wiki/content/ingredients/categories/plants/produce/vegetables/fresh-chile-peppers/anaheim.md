Anaheim chile = California green chile = long green pepper = chile verde [CHEE-lay VER-day] These large, mild chiles are perfect for chiles rellenos. Mexican cooks also like to dice or pur�e them, and then add them to sauces, soups, and casseroles. They have a tough skin, but it peels off easily if you first char the chiles over a flame and then steam them in a paper bag for several minutes. Anaheims are available year-round, but they're best in the summer. When mature and red, an Anaheim is called a chile colorado = California red chile. Substitutes: New Mexico green chile (very similar, but hotter) OR poblano chile (Poblanos are sweeter and a bit hotter than Anaheims, and their skin isn't as tough. They�re especially good for stuffing.) OR Big Jim chile (hotter) OR canned green chilies (preferably fire-roasted)
