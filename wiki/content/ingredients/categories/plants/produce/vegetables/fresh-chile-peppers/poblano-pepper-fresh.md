poblano pepper (fresh) = (incorrectly) ancho chile = (incorrectly) pasilla pepper Pronunciation: puh-BLAH-noh Notes: These mild, heart-shaped peppers are large and have very thick walls, which make them great for stuffing. They're best in the summer. Substitutes: Anaheim (Like poblanos, these are great for stuffing. Since they have a tougher skin, you may want to char, steam, and peel them first.) OR bell pepper (for stuffing, milder) OR canned chile peppers (preferably fire-roasted) OR Serrano pepper (hotter)
