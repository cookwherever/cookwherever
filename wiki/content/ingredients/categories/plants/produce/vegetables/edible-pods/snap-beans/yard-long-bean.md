yard-long bean = asparagus bean = dow gok = dau gok = Chinese long bean = long bean = bodi = boonchi These beans usually aren't a yard long--half a yard is more typical. Asians like to cut them into smaller pieces and add them to their stir-fried dishes. You can also boil or steam them like green beans, though they're not as sweet and juicy. They don't store well, so use them within a few days of purchase. Thailand long bean OR green bean (smaller and sweeter)
