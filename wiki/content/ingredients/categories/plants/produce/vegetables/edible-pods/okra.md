okra = ochro = okro = bamia = bamie = bhindi = bindi = gumbo = gombo = ladies' fingers = ladyfingers = quingombo = quiabo Notes: When cooked, okra exudes a slimy substance, which serves as a wonderful thickener in stews. Unfortunately, that sliminess puts off many diners, but you can minimize it by buying small, fresh okra and by cooking it very briefly. Okra's popular in the South, where they fry it in cornmeal, pickle it (this also gets rid of the sliminess), and use it to thicken their gumbos. Substitutes: gumbo fil� (This is also used a thickener in gumbos. Substitute one tablespoon gumbo fil� for every three cups okra, but don't add the gumbo fil� until after the gumbo has been completely cooked.) OR nopales (also serves as a thickener) OR asparagus (takes longer to cook) OR eggplant (takes longer to cook) OR purslane
