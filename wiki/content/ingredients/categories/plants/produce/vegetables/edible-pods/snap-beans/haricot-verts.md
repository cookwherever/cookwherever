haricot verts = French bean = French green bean = French filet bean This is a very thin variety of green bean that's crisp, tender, and expensive. Don't confuse this with the haricot bean, which is a dry bean. Substitutes: green beans (as thin as possible; consider cutting thicker green beans in half lengthwise)
