Swiss chard = chard = spinach beet = leaf beet = seakale beet = silver beet = white beet Swiss chard is used much like spinach, except that it has an appealing beet-like flavor and a heavier texture, which requires longer cooking. Many cooks simply sautï¿½ it in olive oil and serve it as a side dish. Red chard = rhubarb chard = ruby chard, with green leaves and red stalks, is slightly more tender and flavorful than white chard = green chard, with white stalks and green leaves, but the two are interchangeable in most recipes. Substitutes: beet greens OR spinach OR turnip greens OR bok choy OR escarole OR mustard greens
