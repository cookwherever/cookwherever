turnip greens = turnip tops = turnip salad = Hanover greens A staple of Southern cuisine, turnips greens are traditionally served with salt pork or ham hocks. The leaves are pungent and slightly bitter, especially older ones, but they become milder when cooked. Don't prepare them with aluminum cookware, as it will affect their flavor and appearance. Substitutes: dandelion greens OR mustard greens OR kale (takes longer to cook) OR collard greens (takes longer to cook, consider blanching first to reduce bitterness) OR Swiss chard (milder flavor) OR spinach (milder flavor)
