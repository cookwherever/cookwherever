Chinese broccoli = Chinese kale = gai lan = gai lum = kai lan Notes: Like rapini, Chinese broccoli has small stems and green heads (which actually are flowers) and lots of leaves. But Chinese broccoli is leafier and less bitter than rapini. It's a great vegetable to stir-fry, but you can also steam or boil it, as you would broccoli. Substitutes: rapini OR broccoli OR bok choy
