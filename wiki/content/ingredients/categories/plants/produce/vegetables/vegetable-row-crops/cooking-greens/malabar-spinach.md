Malabar spinach = Ceylon spinach = saan choy = slippery vegetable = alogbati = mong toi = Vietnamese spinach This is cooked much like spinach, but it's a bit slimy like okra. It occasionally shows up in Asian markets. Substitutes: spinach OR okra mustard greens = curled mustard These are more popular in the South than in the rest of the country. There are red and green varieties, and both have a peppery bite. If the greens are too pungent for your taste, you can tame them by blanching them in salted water. Substitutes: gai choy (less pungent) OR escarole (less pungent) OR kale (less pungent) OR Swiss chard (less pungent) OR spinach (less pungent; cooks more quickly) OR radish greens nettles = nettle leaves Shopping hints: Nettles have long been used in Europe as a substitute for spinach or kale, but they're tricky to use. The tips contain formic acid, a nasty irritant that can give you a serious rash on the outside and cause even more damage on the inside. You can remove the formic acid by cooking and/or soaking the nettles, but don't try this unless you know what you're doing. If you're harvesting your own nettle leaves, select young ones. Substitutes: escarole OR beet greens OR spinach
