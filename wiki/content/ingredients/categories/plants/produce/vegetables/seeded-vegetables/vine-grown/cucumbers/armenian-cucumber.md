Armenian cucumber = snake melon = snake cucumber = uri This is hard to find, but one of the best-regarded slicing cucumbers. It's crisp, thin-skinned, and mild-flavored, and it has soft seeds. Like the English cucumber, it doesn't need to be peeled or seeded. It's not good for pickling. Substitutes: English cucumber
