garden cucumber = market cucumber = common cucumber = regular cucumber = outdoor cucumber = field-grown cucumbers You can find these throughout the year at all but the most poorly stocked markets. The ones you find in supermarkets are usually waxed to hold in moisture and improve shelf-life--these should be peeled or at least scrubbed well before serving. Unwaxed cucumbers don't need to be peeled, but better cooks often do so since the peels tend to be thick and bitter. It's also a good idea to remove the seeds from these kinds of cucumbers; just cut them in half lengthwise and scrape them out. Select cukes that are firm, dark green, and rounded at the tips. Substitutes: English cucumber (Less flavorful, but doesn't need to be peeled or seeded.) OR Japanese cucumber OR Armenian cucumber OR lemon cucumber
