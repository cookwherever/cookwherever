fresh lima bean = fresh butter bean = fresh Madagascar bean = fresh wax bean Notes: These are exquisitely sweet and tender, as long as you get to them soon after they're picked. The freshest pods are brightly colored and snap crisply when you bend them. Fresh lima beans don't need to be soaked and you need only cook them about 15 minutes. Substitutes: garden peas OR lima beans (dried)
