fresh black-eyed pea = fresh cowpea = fresh crowder pea = fresh lobhia = fresh lombia = fresh black-eye bean = fresh black-eye pea = fresh black-eyed suzy = fresh China bean = fresh chawli = fresh poor man's pea = fresh Southern pea 2 cups fresh peas = 1 cup dried Notes: In their fresh form, black-eyed peas are pale green and have a wonderful, nutty flavor. Unlike dried black-eyed peas, they don't need to be soaked, and they cook much faster. They arrive in markets during the late summer and early fall. Substitutes: black-eyed pea (dried) garden pea = English pea = green pea = shell pea = fresh pea Equivalents: One pound unshelled yields one cup shelled. Notes: These appear in the summer months, and they're so sweet that it's well worth the trouble to shell them. Freshness is crucial, so look for brightly colored pods that are crisp enough to snap. Petits pois are a small and tender variety. Substitutes: edamame OR fresh lima beans
