soybean = soy bean = soya bean This nutritional powerhouse is extremely versatile--it's used to make salad oil, tofu, soy sauce, meat analogs, soy milk and cheese, and many other ingredients. The actual beans need to be soaked a long time and are somewhat hard to digest, but they're extremely nutritious.
