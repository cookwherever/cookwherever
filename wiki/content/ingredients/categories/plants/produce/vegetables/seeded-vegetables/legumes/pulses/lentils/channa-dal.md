channa dal = chana dal = gram dal With their sweet and nutty flavor, these are the most popular dal in India. They're made from splitting a small relative of the chickpea in half. They're a dull yellow and are renown for causing flatulence, which Indians try to counter by adding asafoetida to the dish. Substitutes: toor dal (a bit smaller, but similar) OR yellow split peas OR garbanzo beans
