### Taste & Texture
* Creamy when cooked

### Preparation
#### Brine
* 4 cups of water and one teaspoon of salt for one hour
* Reduces blowouts when cooking
* Coat of lentil contains calcium and magnesium ions which makes it very rigid and structural. When interior swells, the rigid coat will not budge and the lentil is put under pressure and will explode.
* [[Brining]] gives lentils a nice pair of stretchy pants
#### Simmer
* Keeping the water from violently boiling, with a gentile simmer, will reduce the risk of blowouts. 
* Using a moderately warm oven can help with this.
