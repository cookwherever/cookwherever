toor dal = tuvar dal = arhar dal = yellow lentils = tur dal Whole toor lentils are yellow with tan jackets, but they're usually sold skinned and split. They have a mild, nutty flavor, and they're often cooked as a side dish or ground into flour. They're sometimes sold with an oily coating, which you should rinse off. Look for them at Indian markets. Substitutes: channa dal OR yellow split peas OR pigeon peas
