lablab bean = hyacinth bean = bonavist bean = Egyptian bean = Fuji mame = Indian bean = val These beans can be brown, reddish-brown, or cream colored, and they're easily identified by a white seed scar which runs along one edge. They have a pleasant nutty flavor, but they need to soaked and peeled before cooking. Skinned and split lablab beans, called val dal in Hindu, are more convenient to use. Both whole and split beans are available in Indian markets. Substitutions: black-eyed peas OR split peas lima bean = butter bean = Madagascar bean = wax bean Pronunciation: LIE-muh Notes: With their buttery flavor, lima beans are great in soups or stews, or on their own as a side dish. The most popular varieties are the small baby lima bean = sieva bean and the larger Fordhooks. You can get limas fresh in their pods in the summer, but many people prefer to use dried lima beans. Shelled frozen limas are a good substitute for fresh, but canned limas aren't nearly as good. The biggest downside is that lima beans are harder to digest than other beans. Substitutes: fresh lima beans OR fava beans (more flavorful) OR soybeans
