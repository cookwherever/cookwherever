lima bean = butter bean = Madagascar bean = wax bean Pronunciation: LIE-muh Notes: With their buttery flavor, lima beans are great in soups or stews, or on their own as a side dish. The most popular varieties are the small baby lima bean = sieva bean and the larger Fordhooks. You can get limas fresh in their pods in the summer, but many people prefer to use dried lima beans. Shelled frozen limas are a good substitute for fresh, but canned limas aren't nearly as good. The biggest downside is that lima beans are harder to digest than other beans. Substitutes: fresh lima beans OR fava beans (more flavorful) OR soybeans
