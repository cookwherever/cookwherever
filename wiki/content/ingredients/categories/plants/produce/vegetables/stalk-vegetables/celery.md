celery 1 rib = 1/2 cup sliced Notes: Raw celery is flavorful and wonderfully crunchy, and it's a great vehicle for dips or fillings like peanut butter or cream cheese. Celery can also be saut�ed and used to flavor soups, stews, and sauces. A bunch or stalk of celery consists of a dozen or so individual ribs, with the tender innermost ribs called the celery heart. Substitutes: carrots (for snacking) OR fennel stalks (takes longer to cook) OR Chinese celery (This is a good substitute if the celery is to be cooked; Chinese celery has a more intense flavor than conventional celery.) OR bok choy (raw or cooked) OR cardoon (for cooking) OR jicama (for snacking or crudit�s) Chinese celery = khuen chai = kinchay This has a stronger flavor than ordinary celery, and it's often used in stir-fries and soups. Look for it in Asian markets. Substitutes: celery
