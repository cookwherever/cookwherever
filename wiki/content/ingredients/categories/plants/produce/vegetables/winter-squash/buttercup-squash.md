buttercup squash With sweet and creamy orange flesh, the buttercup is one of the more highly regarded winter squashes. The biggest shortcoming is that it tends to be a bit dry. Choose specimens that are heavy for their size. Substitutes: butternut squash (nuttier, sweeter flavor; easier to peel when raw) OR acorn squash (less flavorful, moister) OR Hubbard squash OR delicata squash OR kabocha squash OR pumpkin OR green papaya
