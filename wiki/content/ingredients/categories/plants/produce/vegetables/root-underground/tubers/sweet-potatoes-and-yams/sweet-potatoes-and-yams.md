### Other Names


### Preparation
#### Sous Vide
* 135-170F for a couple hours

##### Concepts
* Starch in a potato is a [[polysaccharide]] made up of glucose
* Cooking transforms the [[polysaccharide]]s into maltose, which are sugars we can taste.
* An enzyme becomes active to break down the starch at 135F and stops when it becomes denatured at 170F
