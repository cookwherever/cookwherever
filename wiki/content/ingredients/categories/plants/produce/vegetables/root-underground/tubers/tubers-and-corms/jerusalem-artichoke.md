Jerusalem artichoke = sunchoke = sunroot = topinambour = girasole Equivalents: One cup sliced = 150 grams Notes: These look like small, knobby potatoes, but they have a crisp texture and an interesting earthy flavor. You can eat them raw, stir-fry them, or bake them like potatoes. It's best not to peel them, but you'll want to scrub off the dirt. If you slice them, dunk them immediately in acidulated water to keep them from discoloring. Substitutes: artichoke hearts (Artichoke hearts are less crunchy, but their flavor is somewhat similar flavor to Jerusalem artichokes.) OR potatoes (This is a good substitute if the recipe calls for the Jerusalem artichokes to be baked.) OR water chestnuts ( These have a similar texture to Jerusalem artichokes.) OR jicama ( This is less expensive than Jerusalem artichokes. The texture is similar, but the flavor is completely different.)
