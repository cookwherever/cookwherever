lotus root Slices of the lotus root have a beautiful pattern. The fresh version is available sporadically; if not, the canned version is almost as good. Rinse and drain before using. Look for it in Asian markets. Substitutes: water chestnuts OR sunchokes OR jicama (This is cheaper, but has a less delicate flavor.)
