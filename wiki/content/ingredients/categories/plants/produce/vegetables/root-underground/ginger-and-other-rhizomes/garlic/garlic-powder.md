garlic powder = powdered garlic Garlic powder provides some of the flavor, but not the texture, of fresh garlic. It disperses well in liquids, so it's a good choice for marinades. Substitutes: fresh garlic (Substitute 1 clove for every 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder.) OR garlic salt (Substitute 4 teaspoons garlic salt for every teaspoon garlic powder, then reduce salt in recipe by 3 teaspoons.) OR garlic juice (1/8 teaspoon garlic powder = 1/2 teaspoon garlic juice) OR garlic flakes (1/8 teaspoon garlic powder = 1/2 teaspoon garlic flakes) OR granulated garlic (1/8 teaspoon garlic powder = 1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic )
