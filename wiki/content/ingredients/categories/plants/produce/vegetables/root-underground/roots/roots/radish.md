radish With their crisp texture and peppery flavor, raw radishes are great in salads and on cruditï¿½ platters. They can also be cut into attractive garnishes. Select firm, fresh-looking radishes and store them in your refrigerator for no more than a week. Substitutes: daikon (slightly hotter) OR jicama (for snacking)
