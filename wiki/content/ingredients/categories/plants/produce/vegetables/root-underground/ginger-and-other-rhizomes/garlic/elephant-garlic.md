elephant garlic = great-headed garlic = Oriental garlic Notes: This looks like an overgrown garlic, but it's more closely related to a leek. It's much milder than ordinary garlic, so it's a good choice if you want to impart the flavor of garlic to a delicately flavored dish. It's often sold in a mesh stocking to keep the cloves together. Substitutes: garlic (smaller and more potent)
