carrot Notes: Raw or cooked, carrots add sweetness and color to stews, soups, stir-fries, slaws, cakes, and cruditï¿½ platters, plus they're a great source of Vitamin A. Try to buy them with the greens still attached, they're usually fresher and sweeter that way. Equivalents: 1 large carrot = 1 cup grated Substitutes: parsnip (don't serve raw) OR jicama OR daikon (especially if served raw) OR celery (good raw or cooked) OR celeriac (consider blanching first if using in a raw salad) OR turnip (if cooked) OR kohlrabi (great cooked or raw) OR broccoli OR rutabagas (if cooked) OR cauliflower OR salsify (dip in acidulated water after peeling to prevent them from turning black)
