purple potato = purple Peruvian potato = blue potato = black potato These purple-fleshed potatoes have a medium starch content, so they're good all-purpose potatoes. They lend an interesting color to mashed potatoes or potato salads, but they're not as flavorful as other varieties. They tend to get mushy if they're over-cooked. Substitutes: Yukon Gold OR Yellow Finn
