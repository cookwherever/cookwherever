shallot Australians use the term shallots to describe green onions, but to Americans, shallots are shaped like small brown onions with papery brown skins. They have a more delicate, garlicky flavor than other cooking onions, and are a common ingredient in French sauces. Many people find them too hot to eat raw. They're available year-round. Substitutes: green onions (white part only) OR onions (1 small onion = 3 shallots) + dash crushed garlic OR red onion OR green onions OR garlic
