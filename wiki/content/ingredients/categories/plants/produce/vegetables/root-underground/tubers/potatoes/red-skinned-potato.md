red-skinned potato = red potato = red round potato These waxy potatoes hold their shape after they're cooked, so they're great for making potato salads and scalloped potatoes. Don't mash them--you'll end up with a sticky, gooey mess. Substitutes: Yellow Finn potato (yellow flesh) OR Yukon Gold potato (yellow flesh) OR white round
