sweet onion = fresh onion = spring onion = summer onion These onions are mild and crisp, so they're the onions of choice for slicing raw on burgers and sandwiches. They can be lightly cooked, too, though they're not as pungent and flavorful as storage onions. There are several different varieties, often named after the region in which they're grown. The most popular include Vidalia, Walla Walla, Sweet Imperial, Texas Spring Sweet, Texas 1015Y, Carzalia Sweet, Oso Sweet, Arizona, Granex, and Maui. They're usually available from March through August, though some producers extend the season by storing them in a low-oxygen environment. Sweet onions are usually larger than storage onions. They also have a higher water content, so they don't keep as well. Substitutes: Spanish onion (This isn't as sweet, so consider adding up to one tablespoon of sugar per onion to the recipe.) OR Bermuda onion (This isn't as sweet, so consider adding up to one tablespoon of sugar per onion to the recipe.) OR red onion OR bulbs of green onions
