tarragon Notes: The French are especially fond of this aromatic, anise-like herb. They often use it to flavor delicately flavored foods like eggs, fish, cheese, and chicken, and it's an indispensable ingredient in sauce bï¿½arnaise and in the herb mixture the French call fines herbes. Use it sparingly--a little goes a long way. Frozen tarragon is an excellent substitute for fresh, but use the dried version only in a pinch. Substitutes: dill OR basil OR marjoram OR fennel seed OR anise seed OR angelica thyme Pronunciation: TIME Equivalents: 1 tablespoon fresh = 3/4 teaspoon dried Notes: This herb is widely used in Mediterranean countries to flavor stews and meat sauces. It's often used in combination with other herbs, like rosemary, parsley, and oregano. Use dried thyme only in a pinch--fresh thyme is far more flavorful. Substitutes: omit from recipe OR herbes de Provence (This blend contains thyme.) OR poultry seasoning (This blend contains thyme.) OR Italian seasoning (This blend contains thyme.) OR savory OR marjoram OR oregano
