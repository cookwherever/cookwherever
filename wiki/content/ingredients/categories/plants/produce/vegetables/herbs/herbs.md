* Make food taste better and look better (as a garnish)

### Categories
#### Tender
* Stems are "tender"
* Delicate flavor
* [[chives]], [[dill]], [[tarragon]], [[parsley]], [[cilantro]], [[mint]]
* 1 to 1 substitution for each other in recipes (1 tbsp of cilantro can be used for 1 tbsp of parsley), different flavors, but similar intensity

#### Hardy
* Woody stems
* [[sage]], [[oregano]], [[thyme]], [[rosemary]]
* Potent flavors

### Substitutes
* 1 tablespoon fresh = 1 teaspoon dried
* Hardy herbs will be herbs that can be dried since their essential oils can survive the drying process
* Add dried herbs early to a recipe vs finishing with them as a garnish

### Storage
* Remove rubber bands
* Wash and dry
* Wrap in paper towel and place in container (like a zip lock bag)
