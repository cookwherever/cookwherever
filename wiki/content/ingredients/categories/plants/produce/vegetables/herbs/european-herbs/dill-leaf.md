dill leaf = dillweed = dill weed Notes: You can find soft, feathery sprigs of dill leaves in markets throughout the year. Chopped dill is often paired with fish, cucumbers, potatoes, or it's added to dips, salad dressings, or cream sauces. Dill loses flavor when it's heated, so always add it to cooked dishes at the last minute. Avoid dried dill; it has very little flavor. And don't confuse dill leaves with dill seeds--though they come from the same plant, they're not good substitutes for one another. Substitutes: tarragon (especially in sauces that accompany fish or eggs) OR fennel leaves (as a garnish; looks very similar)
