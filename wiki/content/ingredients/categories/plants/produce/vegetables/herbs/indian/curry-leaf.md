curry leaf = meetha neem = kari patta These look like small bay leaves and smell like limes. Dried leaves are easier to find than fresh, but they aren't very good. Substitutes: bay leaf (different flavor) OR basil (different flavor) OR kaffir lime leaves (different flavor) fenugreek leaves = holba = methi leaves FEHN-yoo-greek Notes: This mildly bitter herb is believed to have medicinal properties. Dried leaves, either whole or ground, are called kasuri methi, and they're a good substitute for fresh. Look for fresh or dried leaves in Indian markets. Substitutes: celery leaves
