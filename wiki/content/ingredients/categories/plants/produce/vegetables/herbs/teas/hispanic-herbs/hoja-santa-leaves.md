hoja santa leaves = hierba santa = rootbeer plant leaves Notes: These heart-shaped leaves impart a root beer flavor to dishes, and they're great for wrapping tamales and other foods. They're hard to find; your best bet is a Hispanic market. Substitutes: unsprayed avocado leaves OR chopped fennel (if recipe calls for leaves to be chopped) OR Swiss chard (if recipe calls for leaves to be chopped) OR banana leaves (as a food wrapper) OR corn husks (for wrapping tamales) OR epazote (Large leaves are great for wrapping tamales.) OR Swiss chard (If recipe calls for hoja santa leaves to be chopped.)
