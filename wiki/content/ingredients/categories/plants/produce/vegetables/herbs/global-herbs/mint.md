mint Equivalents: 1 tablespoon fresh = 1 teaspoon dried Notes: Mint is used throughout the world to flavor everything from lamb to candy. It's also a great garnish and breath freshener. Spearmint is the variety you're most likely to encounter in markets, and it's the best choice for savory dishes. Peppermint = brandy mint has a stronger flavor and is best suited to dessert recipes. Used dried mint only in a pinch--it's not nearly as flavorful as fresh. Substitutes: fresh parsley + pinch of dried mint OR basil (especially in Thai cuisine) OR shiso
