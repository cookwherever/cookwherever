lovage = wild celery = smallage = smellage LOVE-age Notes: Lovage tastes like celery, but it's even more pungent and flavorful. The only drawback but it can't withstand long cooking like celery can. Use it in any recipe that calls for celery, but use less and add it to cooked dishes at the last minute. Substitutes: equal parts parsley and celery leaves OR Chinese celery OR celery leaves (milder) OR parsley OR chervil
