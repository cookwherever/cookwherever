avocado leaves = hoja de aguacate Mexican cooks use these to impart an anise-like aroma to foods. They're often used as wrappers, or crumbled into stews. Toast the leaves before using. Substitutes: banana leaves (as a wrapper) OR hoja santa OR fennel (if chopped leaves are called for) OR maguey leaves (as a wrapper) boldo leaves These small leaves have a strong woodsy aroma. They're hard to find, but Hispanic markets sometimes carry dried leaves in cellophane bags. Substitutes: Indian bay leaves (also hard to find) OR ordinary bay leaves
