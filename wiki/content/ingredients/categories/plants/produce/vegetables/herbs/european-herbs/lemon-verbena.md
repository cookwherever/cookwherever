lemon verbena = verbena ver-BEE-nuh Notes: This has a strong lemon flavor that works especially well in teas and vegetable dishes. If you can't find it in the spice section, cut open lemon verbena teabags. Substitutes: lemongrass OR lemon zest lovage = wild celery = smallage = smellage LOVE-age Notes: Lovage tastes like celery, but it's even more pungent and flavorful. The only drawback but it can't withstand long cooking like celery can. Use it in any recipe that calls for celery, but use less and add it to cooked dishes at the last minute. Substitutes: equal parts parsley and celery leaves OR Chinese celery OR celery leaves (milder) OR parsley OR chervil marjoram = sweet marjoram = knot marjoram = knotted marjoram MAR-jer-um Notes: Marjoram is sweeter and milder than its close relative, oregano. It's often used to season meats and fish, and works best when its added near the end of the cooking period. Fresh is best, but frozen or dried marjoram are acceptable substitutes. Don't confuse this with wild marjoram, which is better known as oregano. Equivalents: 1 tablespoon fresh = 1 teaspoon dried. Substitutes: oregano (This is very similar, but not as sweet and mild as marjoram. Substitute two parts of oregano for three parts of marjoram.) OR thyme OR sage OR basil OR summer savory
