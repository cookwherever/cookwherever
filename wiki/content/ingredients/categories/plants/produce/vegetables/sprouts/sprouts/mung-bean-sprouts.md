mung bean sprouts = bean sprouts These are the large sprouts that are common in supermarkets. They're crisp and nutty, and they're the best sprouts for stir-frying, though they can also be served raw. Select bean sprouts that are crisp and white with just a tinge of yellow. To keep them fresh, rinse them off and immerse them in cold water, then store them in the refrigerator. They're very perishable, so try to use them within a day or two. Canned bean sprouts are a very poor substitute for fresh. Substitutes: snow peas (sturdy enough to cook) OR sunflower sprouts (sturdy enough to cook) OR soybean sprouts (bigger, bean-like flavor)
