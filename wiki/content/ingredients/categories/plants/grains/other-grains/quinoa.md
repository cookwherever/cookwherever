quinoa = hie KEEN-wah Notes: This ancient seed was a staple of the Incas. It cooks quickly and has a mild flavor and a delightful, slightly crunchy, texture. It's got a lot of the amino acid lysine, so it provides a more complete protein than many other cereal grains. It comes in different colors, ranging from a pale yellow to red to black. Rinse quinoa before using to remove its bitter natural coating. Substitutes: couscous OR rice OR bulgur OR millet OR buckwheat groats OR amaranth quinoa flakes This is steamed, rolled, and flaked quinoa. It's used like oatmeal to make a hot cereal. Substitutes: rolled oats teff This Ethiopian staple is the world's smallest grain. Since it's too tiny to process, teff isn't stripped of nutrients like other, more refined grains. As a result, it's a nutritional powerhouse, especially rich in protein and calcium, and it's gluten-free. It has a sweet, nutty flavor and is sometimes eaten as a hot breakfast cereal. It comes in different colors that range from creamy white to reddish-brown. Substitutes: quinoa (use twice as much)
