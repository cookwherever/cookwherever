instant rice = precooked rice This is white rice that's been precooked and dehydrated so that it cooks quickly. It's relatively expensive, though, and you sacrifice both flavor and texture. White instant rice cooks in about five minutes, brown in about ten. Minute Rice is a well-known brand. Substitutes: long-grain rice (less expensive, more nutritious, takes longer to cook)
