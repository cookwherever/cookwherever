white rice = polished rice = pearled rice Most varieties of rice are processed into white rice at the mill, where the grains are scoured to remove the husk, bran, and part of the germ. This processing strips some of the nutrients, but make the rice tender and fast-cooking. Many producers sell enriched white rice, which restores some of the nutrients. If well-sealed, white rice can be stored almost indefinitely in a cool, dry place. Substitutes: converted rice (more nutritious, takes longer to cook) OR brown rice (nuttier flavor, chewier, less fluffy, more fiber and nutrients, takes longer to cook)
