short-grain rice = round grain rice = pearl rice Notes: This is sticky, though not as much as glutinous rice. It's a good choice if you're making sushi or rice pudding, and it also works pretty well in a risotto or paella. Brown short-grain rice isn't as sticky. Substitutes: medium-grain rice (fluffier, less sticky) OR long-grain rice (even fluffier, even less sticky)
