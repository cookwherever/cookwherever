bulgur = bulgur wheat = ala = birghil = bulgar = bulghur = burghal = burghul Pronunciation: BUHL-guhr or BOOL-guhr Equivalents: One cup of dry bulgur yields about 3 cups of cooked bulgur. Notes: Bulgur is made from whole wheat that's been soaked and baked to speed up the cooking time. It's especially popular in the Middle East, where it's used to make tabouli and pilafs. Bulgur comes either whole, or cracked into fine, medium, or coarse grains. To make your own: Bring to a boil one part rinsed whole wheat berries plus two parts water or other liquid, then simmer the berries are tender (about one hour). Spread the berries on a cookie sheet and bake in a 225� F oven, stirring occasionally, until dry (about one hour). Grind in a blender or crush with a rolling pin. Substitutes: cracked wheat (takes longer to cook) OR couscous OR quinoa (especially in tabouli) OR wheat berries (This works well in tabouli, but the berries need to be cooked first) OR rice OR couscous
