pot barley = Scotch barley This isn't as heavily processed as pearl barley, in that the endosperm is left intact, along with the inner pearl of the kernel. It takes about an hour to cook. Look for it in health food stores. Substitutes: pearl barley (Lacks endosperm, takes less time to cook.) OR hulled barley (more nutritious, gritty texture)
