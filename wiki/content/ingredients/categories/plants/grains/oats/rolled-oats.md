rolled oats = oatmeal = rolled oatmeal = old-fashioned oats = old-fashioned oatmeal = flaked oats = flaked oatmeal = oatflakes Notes: These are oat groats that are steamed, rolled, and flaked so that they cook quickly. They're often cooked as a breakfast cereal, added raw to granola or muesli mixes, or used to make oatmeal cookies. Regular rolled oats take about five minutes to cook. If you're in a hurry, try quick oats or instant oats. These have thinner flakes, so they cook faster. Substitutes: steel-cut oats (chewier, takes longer to cook) OR quick oats (These are less chewy, but they take less time to cook.) OR instant oats (These usually have additional flavorings. They're less chewy, but they take less time to cook.) OR triticale flakes OR rye flakes
