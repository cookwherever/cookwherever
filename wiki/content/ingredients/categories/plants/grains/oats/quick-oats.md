quick oats = quick-cooking oats = quick oatmeal = quick-cooking oatmeal = easy oats These are thin flakes of oatmeal that cook up in about three or four minutes. They're a good choice for oatmeal cookies. Substitutes: rolled oats (More nutritious and chewy, takes longer to cook. If substituting rolled oats for quick oats in a cookie recipe, consider refrigerating the dough for 20 minutes before baking-- otherwise the cookies may become too flat and thin) OR instant oats (This contains additional flavorings, and is less chewy. It also takes less time to cook)
