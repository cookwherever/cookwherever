kasha = kasza = roasted buckwheat groats = toasted buckwheat groats Pronunciation: KAH-shuh Notes: This is the Russian name for buckwheat groats that have been toasted in oil to remove buckwheat's natural bitterness and to bring out a sweeter, nuttier flavor. They come whole or crushed into a coarse, medium, or fine grain. Substitutes: buckwheat groats (Untoasted groasts have a milder, more bitter flavor compared to kasha. You can convert them into kasha yourself by cooking them in oil until they're rust colored.) OR rice unhulled buckwheat groats These are used for making sprouts.
