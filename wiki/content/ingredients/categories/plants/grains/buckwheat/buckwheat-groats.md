buckwheat groats = unroasted buckwheat groats = raw buckwheat groats = whole white buckwheat groats. Notes: These are buckwheat kernels that are stripped of their inedible outer coating and then crushed into smaller pieces. Unprocessed white groats are slightly bitter, so before you cook them it's a good idea to toast them in oil for several minutes until they're rust-colored. This removes the bitterness and brings out a pleasant, nutty flavor. If you don't want to do this yourself, you can buy already roasted groats, called kasha. Substitutes: kasha (similar texture, nuttier flavor) OR millet OR amaranth OR quinoa
