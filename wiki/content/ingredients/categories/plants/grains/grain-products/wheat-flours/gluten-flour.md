gluten flour = instant gluten flour = pure gluten flour = vital wheat gluten This is flour with the starch and bran removed. Don't confuse it with bread flour = high-gluten flour, which is gluten-fortified flour, or with gluten = seitan, a meat analogue used in vegetarian dishes. Pure gluten flour is usually added to regular flour to turn it into bread flour, or it's used to make seitan.
