soba = buckwheat noodles SO-bah Notes: These chewy Japanese noodles are popular at soup counters in Tokyo. They're made with a blend of wheat and buckwheat flours, the more buckwheat the better. They're often sold fresh (called nama soba) in Japan, but foreigners usually have to settle for dried. Soba comes in different widths and flavors, including green cha soba = chasoba, which is flavored with green tea, and yamaimo soba, flavored with yams. Cook them for about 3 minutes. Substitutes: Korean buckwheat noodles OR udon (thicker, different flavor) OR wholewheat pasta (linguine or spaghetti) OR linguine OR spaghetti,
