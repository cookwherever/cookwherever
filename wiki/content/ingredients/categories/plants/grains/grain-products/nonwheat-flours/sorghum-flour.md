sorghum flour = jowar flour = jowari flour = juwar flour = cholam flour This is widely used in India and Africa, especially by poor farmers who can't afford wheat flour. It's somewhat bland but very nutritious and gluten-free. You can sometimes find it in health foods stores, but you can get it for less in an Indian market. Substitutes: rice flour OR potato flour
