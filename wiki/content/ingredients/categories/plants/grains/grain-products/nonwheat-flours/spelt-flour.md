spelt flour Spelt flour contains gluten, but it's tolerated by many people with gluten allergies. If making bread with spelt flour, don't knead it for as long as you would a wheat bread--its gluten isn't as durable as that in wheat. Freeze any spelt flour that you're not planning to use right away. Substitutes: kamut flour (like spelt flour, kamut flour is tolerated by most people with wheat allergies and is good for making bread and pasta) teff flour Grind teff in a blender until it has the consistency of flour) Substitutes: (for injera) equal parts wheat and rye flours (lacks distinctive flavor of teff flour)
