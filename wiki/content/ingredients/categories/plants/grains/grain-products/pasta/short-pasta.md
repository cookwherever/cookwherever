short pasta = short goods These are pasta tubes and shapes that are relatively small, but larger than soup pasta. They tend to be sturdy, so they work well in casseroles and pasta salads. They're also easier to eat than rods or ribbons, so they're great for serving kids or large crowds. Substitutes: long pasta (broken into short lengths)
