lasagne luh-ZAHN-yuh Notes: These thick, wide noodles with ruffled edges are used to make an Italian casserole dish that Americans call lasagne. Italians call the noodle itself lasagna (plural: lasagne), and the casserole lasagne al forno. Thinner noodles are best. Precooked lasagne = oven-ready lasagne = no-boil lasagne work fairly well and save time, but the noodles tend to absorb moisture from the sauce, resulting in a drier product. Substitutes: polenta (This works well in lasagne casseroles.) OR pasta sheet OR rice paper (Use several dry sheets to replace each layer of noodles.)
