ravioli ra-vee-OH-lee Notes: These are small, square pillows of stuffed pasta that are often served with a light sauce. The traditional filling is ricotta cheese mixed with spinach or some other cooking green, but adventurous cooks have used wild mushrooms, sweet potatoes, winter squash, goat cheese, lobster, nuts, and even prunes. Ravioli are usually topped with a tomato or cream sauce, or with grated cheese. Don't overcook them or they'll fall apart. Smaller ravioli are called ravioletti, and a single one is called a raviolo. Substitutes: pansotti OR agnolotti OR cappelletti OR tortellini
