ramen RAH-min OR RAH-mane Notes: A staple of Japanese salarymen and American college students, these Japanese noodles can be used in soups or salads. You can find bricks of instant ramen in many supermarkets, packaged in cellophane along with seasoning packets which you can use or discard. These noodles are usually fried in oil before they're dried, so they tend to be high in fat. They cook in about 2 to 3 minutes. Asian stores also carry fresh or frozen ramen noodles. Substitutes: lo mein noodles ("Ramen" is thought to be a corruption of the Chinese "lo mein.") OR saimin (lower in fat) OR soba (lower in fat) OR rice sticks
