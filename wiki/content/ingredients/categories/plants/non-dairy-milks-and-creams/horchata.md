horchata This is a Spanish beverage made with rice, almonds, or chufa. Horchatas sold in markets are often flavored with chocolate, cinnamon, or fruit. Varieties: Hispanic stores often carry almond horchata = horchata de almendra, chufa horchata = horchata de chufa, the traditional Spanish version, and rice horchata = horchata de arroz. To make your own: Soak one cup uncooked rice in 6 cups hot water for at least 2 hours, then simmer for 20 minutes. Puree in a blender, then strain. Add one teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 cup sugar.
