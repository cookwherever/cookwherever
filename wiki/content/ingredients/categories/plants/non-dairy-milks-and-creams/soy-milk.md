soy milk = soymilk = soy beverage = soya milk = soya beverage Made from soybeans, soy milk is sweeter and darker than dairy milk, and it has a distinctive beanlike flavor. It comes refrigerated, or in aseptic containers (either full strength or concentrated), or in powdered form, with varying percentages of fat. A fortified version is available that supplies many of the nutrients normally found in cow's milk. Flavored versions are best for drinking, unflavored for cooking. Shake well before using. To make your own: Here's a recipe for soy milk. Substitutes: cow's milk (less expensive and more nutritious, but its production involves the exploitation of animals) OR goat's milk (less expensive, more nutritious, exploits animals) OR oat milk (more versatile that soy milk; works well in both sweet and savory dishes) OR rice milk (sweeter than soy milk, best used in desserts) OR almond milk (also sweeter; use it only in desserts)
