oat milk Shopping notes: This comes in aseptic containers. A fortified version is available that supplies many of the nutrients normally found in cow's milk. Substitutes: cow's milk (less expensive and more nutritious, but its production involves the exploitation of animals) OR goat's milk (less expensive, more nutritious, exploits animals) OR soy milk (best used in baked goods; doesn't work well in many savory dishes) OR rice milk (sweeter than oat milk, best used in desserts) OR almond milk (also sweeter; use it only in desserts) Cooking notes: Shake well before using!
