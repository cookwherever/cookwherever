crumpet   These are moist yeast muffins that the British like to slather with butter or clotted cream and serve at teatime. You can buy them ready-made in larger supermarkets, or make them yourself with the help of a crumpet ring and griddle.  Toast them before eating.   Substitutes:  English muffin (very similar)
