ackee = achee = akee = vegetable brains = vegetable egg    uh-KEE  Notes:  The pulp of this fruit looks and tastes like scrambled eggs when cooked, and Jamaicans like to serve it with salt cod.   Look for cans of it in Caribbean markets.  Warning:  Only the yellow pulp on ripe ackees is edible.  Eating underripe ackees that haven't opened on their own, or eating the pink portion of ripe ackees, can cause vomiting and death.
