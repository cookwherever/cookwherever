biscotti biss-COT-tee Notes: Biscotti are cookies that are hard, dry, and intensely flavored--think of them as teething biscuits for adults. They're made by baking a loaf of cookie dough, slicing it, and then baking the slices a second time. They come in several flavors, including almond, chocolate, anise, and hazelnut. They can be stored for a long time in a dry, airtight container. Substitutes: mandlebrot OR amaretti
