quinoa = hie KEEN-wah Notes: This ancient seed was a staple of the Incas. It cooks quickly and has a mild flavor and a delightful, slightly crunchy, texture. It's got a lot of the amino acid lysine, so it provides a more complete protein than many other cereal grains. It comes in different colors, ranging from a pale yellow to red to black. Rinse quinoa before using to remove its bitter natural coating. Substitutes: couscous OR rice OR bulgur OR millet OR buckwheat groats OR amaranth
