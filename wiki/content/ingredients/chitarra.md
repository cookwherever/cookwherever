chitarra = spaghetti alla chitarra These pasta rods resemble spaghetti, only their cross-sections are square instead of round. They're named after the guitar strings that were traditionally used to cut the pasta. Substitutes: spaghetti OR linguine (wider) OR spaghettini (thinner) OR fettucine (ribbons, not strands)
