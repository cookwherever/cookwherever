Hollandaise Sauce   You can cheat and buy this in cans, but the tinny flavor will rat you out.    See the recipes for Hollandaise Sauce, Hollandaise Sauce--Microwave or Quickie Hollandaise Sauce posted on RecipeSource.com.   See RecipeSource postings for   Mock Hollandaise Sauce or Mock Hollandaise Sauce (low cholesterol).horseradish (prepared)   This pungent condiment goes well with meats and fish, and it�s a key ingredient in cocktail sauce.  It�s best to buy horseradish in small amounts and store it in the refrigerator�it turns dark and loses much of its bite after a few months.  Look for it in the deli case.  Varieties:  The most common is white horseradish, which is made with vinegar.  Creamed horseradish = cream-style horseradish has a little mayonnaise and/or sour cream added; horseradish sauce has a lot.  Red horseradish = beet horseradish is made with beet juice.
