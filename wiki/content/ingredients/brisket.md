brisket Northerners like to use the brisket to make corned beef, but Southerners often prefer to barbecue it because they like the way the meat pulls apart into tender, juicy strands. Briskets are usually sold boneless, and often cut into two parts: the flat cut = flat half = first cut = thin cut and the fattier and cheaper point cut = point half = front cut = thick cut. Substitutes: rump roast (good for corned beef) OR bottom round roast (good for corned beef)
