tenderloin roast = whole tenderloin roast = tenderloin tip roast = filet mignon roast Notes: This is the most tender portion of the entire carcass, and you'll pay dearly for it. You can cut it into steaks, or make a heavenly roast beef out of it. Take care not to overcook it, because it dries out easily. Substitutes: rib-eye roast (less tender and expensive) OR rib roast OR top loin OR top sirloin butt roast
