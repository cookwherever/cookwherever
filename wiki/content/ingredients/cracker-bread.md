cracker bread = lavash = lawaash = paraki = Armenian cracker bread = lahvosh = lavosh =lawasha = naan-e-lavaash This is a large flat Middle Eastern bread that comes either hard (like a cracker) or soft (like a tortilla). You can soften hard lavash by moistening both sides and then placing it in a plastic bag for a few hours. Substitutes: matzo OR naan (thicker and not as large) OR flour tortilla (not as large)
