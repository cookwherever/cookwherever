raw milk = real milk = fresh milk A few decades ago, the cream in milk would rise to the top and a glass of milk sitting on the counter would gradually turn sour. No more. Most commercial milk today is homogenized so that the fat is broken into small particles which remain suspended in the milk, and pasteurized to kill bacteria, including the friendly varieties that gave milk a sour tang. Raw milk isn't pasteurized; producers instead keep their cows and dairies clean in order to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. Some people insist raw milk is more healthful than commercial milk since it contains active enzymes that help with digestion and absorption of nutrients. Many cheesemakers prefer it since pasteurization diminishes the cheese's flavor potential and homogenization gives it a waxy texture. Unfortunately, it's illegal to sell raw milk in many states. Substitutes: Nonfat milk mixed with whipping cream (When making cheese, this corrects the texture problem resulting from homogenization.) OR powdered lowfat milk mixed with whipping cream (Also corrects texture problem when making cheese.) OR acidophilis milk (Friendly bacteria is reintroduced into this milk after pasteurization.)
