Coming from a young animal, lamb meat doesn't need to be marbled with fat to be exquisitely tender and delicately flavored. Perhaps lamb would be more popular if more people knew how to cook it properly. Lamb should be roasted at no more than 325ï¿½F, or it gets tough and smells gamy. Select cuts with pink meat and white fat--red meat and yellow fat indicates an older and tougher lamb.
