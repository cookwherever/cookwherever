French green lentils = Puy lentils = lentilles du Puy = lentilles vertes du Puy These choice lentils were originally grown in the volcanic soils of Puy in France, but now they're also grown in North America and Italy. They're especially good in salads since they remain firm after cooking and have a rich flavor. They cook a bit slower than other lentils. Substitutes: beluga lentils OR brown lentils (These don't hold their shape as well as French green lentils.) OR masoor
