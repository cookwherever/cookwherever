fiddlehead fern = pohole = fiddlehead greens = fern      When a fern first emerges from the ground, its uncoiled frond is called a fiddlehead.  Edible varieties of fiddleheads include those from the ostrich fern and the less common  wood fern.  They're available in the late spring and early summer.   Select the smallest, freshest-looking fiddleheads you can find.   Fiddleheads from bracken ferns resemble those from ostrich ferns, but are believed to be carcinogenic. Be very careful if you're gathering fiddleheads from the wild.  Undercooked ostrich fern fiddleheads also have been linked to some cases of food poisoning.  asparagus OR green beans OR spinach
