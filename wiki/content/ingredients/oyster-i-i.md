oyster     The French like to serve these raw in the shell, with just a squirt of fresh lemon juice, but they can also be fried, grilled, or gently poached.  If you eat them raw, you'll need to shuck them first; an oyster knife comes in handy for this.   mussel OR (served raw) littleneck or cherrystone clam OR (deep-fat fried) soft-shell clam    Unopened canned oysters can be stored for up to a year in a dry, cool place. Once opened, it will keep for up to two days if you wrap it well and refrigerate it. periwinkle = bigaros = sea snails = winkles These marine snails are better known in Europe and Japan than in the United States.  They're great in any clam chowder recipe, though they tend to get tough if overcooked.   Look for them in Asian markets.  whelks OR conch OR clams OR escargot
