tequila   teh-KEE-luh  Notes:   This fiery liquor is produced in Mexico from the fermented sap of the blue agave cactus.  Mexicans like to drink it straight after licking salt from the back of their hands (which they squirt first with lime juice to help the salt adhere). Tequila is also used in several cocktails, including the Tequila Sunrise.  Gold tequilas and  white tequilas are very similar.  Tequilas añejas are aged--and more expensive. The very finest tequilas are labeled "100 percent blue agave."  José Cuervo is a well-regarded brand.  Tequila should always be served ice cold.   Substitutes: mezcal (similar, but stronger-tasting) OR gin OR white rum OR vodka
