You should keep a frosted cake wrapped while it�s thawing in the refrigerator so that it doesn�t absorb odors.  Since frosting likes to stick to plastic wrappers, keep the cake in an airtight plastic cake carrier or put it in a cardboard box and then wrap the box tightly with a clean plastic garbage bag.
