kewra essence = kewra oil = attar of kewra = kewra ittar This concentrated oil is made from pandanus flowers, and it's used to flavor meats, desserts, and beverages in India and Southeast Asia. Look for tiny bottles of it in Indian and Asian markets. Don't confuse it with kewra water, which isn't nearly as potent. Substitutes: kewra water (use more) OR rose water (use more)
