farmer cheese = farmer's cheese = farm cheese = pressed cheese = hoop cheese = baker's cheese Notes: This mildly acidic fresh cheese is made by pressing much of the moisture out of cottage cheese. Some varieties resemble a very dry, crumbly cottage cheese, while others have can be sliced. It's primarily used for cooking. To make your own: Wrap cottage cheese in cheesecloth and place in a colander or strainer nested inside a bowl. Place in the refrigerator until much of the liquid has drained into the bowl. Substitutes: queso fresco OR queso blanco OR jack OR Muenster
