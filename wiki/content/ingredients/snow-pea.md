snow pea = Chinese snow pea = Chinese pea = Chinese pea pod = sugar pea = mange-tout pea = edible-podded pea Equivalents: 2 cups fresh = 6 ounces frozen Notes: You eat these whole, pod and all. They're often stir-fried very briefly (no more than a minute), but they're also good raw. They're easy to prepare, just wash and trim the ends. Some people string them as well, but that's not necessary. Select crisp, flat snow peas that snap when you break them. Substitutes: sugar snaps (rounder, sweeter, and crisper) OR asparagus OR (for stir-fry dishes) bean sprouts
