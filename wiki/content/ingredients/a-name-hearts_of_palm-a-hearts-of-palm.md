hearts of palm = palmitos = palm hearts = swamp cabbage      1 cup = 146 grams    These are peeled cabbage palm buds, and they're terrific in salads or as a vegetable side dish. You can buy them fresh only in Florida, but the canned version is quite good.  artichoke hearts (to add to salads) OR asparagus (as a side dish)
