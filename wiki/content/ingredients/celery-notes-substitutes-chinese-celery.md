celery    1 rib = 1/2 cup sliced  Notes:   Raw celery is flavorful and wonderfully crunchy, and it's a great vehicle for dips or fillings like peanut butter or cream cheese.  Celery can also be saut�ed and used to flavor soups, stews, and sauces.  A bunch or stalk of celery consists of a dozen or so individual ribs, with the tender innermost ribs called the celery heart.    Substitutes:  carrots (for snacking) OR fennel stalks (takes longer to cook) OR Chinese celery (This is a good substitute if the celery is to be cooked; Chinese celery has a more intense flavor than conventional celery.) OR bok choy (raw or cooked) OR cardoon (for cooking) OR jicama (for snacking or crudit�s)  Chinese celery = khuen chai = kinchay   This has a stronger flavor than ordinary celery, and it's often used in stir-fries and soups.   Look for it in Asian markets.   Substitutes:  celery
