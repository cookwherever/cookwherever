white miso = shiro miso = shiromiso = mellow miso = sweet miso = sweet white miso = kyoto shiro miso This pale yellow miso is the sweetest and mildest of them all. It's used to make light soups, salad dressings, desserts, and marinades for fish. It's aged only briefly and isn't as salty as other forms of miso. Substitutes: yellow miso OR vegetable bouillon cube (1 tablespoon white miso = 1 vegetable bouillon cube) OR red miso (2 tablespoons red miso = 3 tablespoons white miso)
