hominy = posole = pozole Pronunciation: HAHM-uh-nee Equivalents: 1 cup = 165 grams Notes: These are hulled corn kernels that have been stripped of their bran and germ. Southern cooks usually boil whole or ground hominy until it's tender, and then they serve it in much the same way that Northern cooks would serve potatoes. Varieties include lye hominy, which is made by soaking corn kernels in a weak lye bath, and pearl hominy, which is made by crushing corn kernels mechanically. White hominy is made from white corn kernels, and the sweeter yellow hominy is made from yellow. Samp is coarsely ground or broken hominy, while hominy grits are more finely ground. You can buy hominy canned or dried. Substitutes: barley grits OR dried beans (in stews and soups) OR buckwheat grits OR potatoes (as a side dish)
