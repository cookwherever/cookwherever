guava = guayaba = goyave = guyava Equivalents: One guava yields about 1/2 cup pulp. Notes: These bruise easily, so markets usually sell them while they're still hard and green. Allow them to ripen at room temperature until they become yellow and very aromatic, then either eat or refrigerate them. Don't peel them, just remove the seeds. Substitutes: pineapple OR strawberries
