Poultry is the catch-all term for domesticated birds that are meaty enough to eat. Poultry tends to be lower in saturated fat than other meats, so it's a good choice if you're worried about your health or weight. You can lower the fat still more by removing the skin and by using light meat from the breast instead of the darker meat from the thighs and legs. Younger birds are more tender than older ones, so they're best for grilling, roasting, and frying. Older, tougher birds do better if they're cooked in stews or soups.
