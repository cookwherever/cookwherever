rye whiskey   This American whiskey is made mostly with rye.  It's similar to Bourbon, but not quite as elegant.   Wild Turkey and  Jim Beam are well-regarded brands.  Whiskey should be served at room temperature.  Bourbon (milder flavor) OR blended whiskey OR brandy (good in Manhattans) OR Scotch OR other whiskey OR 1 part vanilla extract + 2 parts water OR sherry whiskey
