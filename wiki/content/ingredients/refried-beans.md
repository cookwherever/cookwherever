refried beans = frijoles refritos These are beans that are cooked, mashed, and then fried, usually in lard or bacon drippings. To make your own: Cook 2 cups of pinto or chili beans in water until they're tender, then drain. Mash the beans, adding enough water to give them the consistency of mashed potatoes, then fry them in 1/2 cup lard, bacon drippings, or butter. Substitutes: pinto beans OR black beans
