rack of lamb = lamb rib roast = lamb rack roast This elegant roast includes eight ribs, and it's big enough to serve three. If the meat at the tips is cut away to expose the bones, it's called a French rack = Frenched rack. Make sure the butcher cracks the chine (backbone) between the ribs, so that the roast is easy to carve when you take it out of the oven. You can make a double French rack by leaning two French racks against each other, bone tips interlaced. You can also tie two or three French racks together, bone tips up, to form a crown roast of lamb for an elegant meal. Substitutes: leg of lamb OR pork loin roast (two of these can be made into a crown roast of pork)lamb rib chop Notes: These exquisite chops are cut from a rack of lamb. They usually contain one rib per chop, but you'll get a thicker and juicier steak with double cut lamb rib chop, which includes two ribs. If the meat at the tip is cut away to expose the bone, it's called a French lamb chop = Frenched lamb chop (shown in the picture). Substitutes: lamb loin chop OR lamb sirloin steak
