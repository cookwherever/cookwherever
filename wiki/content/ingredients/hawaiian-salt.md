Hawaiian salt = alaea salt = Hawaiian sea salt = 'alaea sea salt This unrefined sea salt gets its pinkish-brown color from Hawaiian clay, called 'alaea, which is rich in iron oxide. The clay also imparts a subtle flavor to the salt. The salt is expensive, and hard to find on the mainland. Substitutes: French sea salt OR sea salt OR kosher salt
