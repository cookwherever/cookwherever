hemp seed = hemp seed nut Hemp seeds are a terrific source of protein and other nutrients. Hemp devotees claim that the seeds are as versatile as soybeans, and that they can be made into oil, milk, tofu, and many other goods. Look for the seeds (shelled of their hard green husks) in health foods stores.
