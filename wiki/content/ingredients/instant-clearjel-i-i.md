Instant Clearjel�     This is a modified cornstarch that professional bakers sometimes use to thicken pie fillings.  It has several advantages over ordinary cornstarch.   Instant ClearJel� thickens without cooking, works well with acidic ingredients, tolerates high temperatures, is freezer-stable, and doesn't cause pie fillings to "weep" during storage.   Don't use Instant ClearJel� for canning--it tends to break down.  Substitutes:  ClearJel� (not freezer-stable) OR tapioca starch OR arrowroot starch OR cornstarch
