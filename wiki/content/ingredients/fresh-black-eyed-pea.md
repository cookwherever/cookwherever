fresh black-eyed pea = fresh cowpea = fresh crowder pea = fresh lobhia = fresh lombia = fresh black-eye bean = fresh black-eye pea = fresh black-eyed suzy = fresh China bean = fresh chawli = fresh poor man's pea = fresh Southern pea 2 cups fresh peas = 1 cup dried Notes: In their fresh form, black-eyed peas are pale green and have a wonderful, nutty flavor. Unlike dried black-eyed peas, they don't need to be soaked, and they cook much faster. They arrive in markets during the late summer and early fall. Substitutes: black-eyed pea (dried)
