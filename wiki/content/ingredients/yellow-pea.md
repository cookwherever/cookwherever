yellow pea = yellow matar dal Notes: These have an earthier flavor than green peas. Scandinavians like to use them in soups, while the British use them in their pease pudding. It's best to buy them split, since split peas don't need to be soaked and cook fairly quickly. Substitutes: green pea OR black-eyed peas OR lentils
