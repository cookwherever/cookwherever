callaloo = callilu = calalou = callau = taro leaf = bhaji = elephant's ear = sag = sagaloo Notes: These huge leaves are about a foot and a half long, and they're a popular vegetable among Pacific islanders and some Asians. Many Western cooks steer clear of them, though, since they must be cooked for at least 45 minutes to an hour to rid them of calcium oxalate, a toxin that irritates the throat if swallowed. Substitutes: Chinese spinach (very close substitute) OR Swiss chard OR sorrel OR spinach OR mustard greens OR turnip greens (Discard the stems first. This may take longer to cook than callaloo.) OR collard greens OR meloukhia
