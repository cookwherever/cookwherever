tomatillo = ground tomato = husk tomato = jamberry = Mexican green tomato = Spanish tomato = tomate verde = Mexican husk tomato = Chinese lantern plants = fresadilla = miltomate toh-mah-TEE-yoh Plural: tomatillosTomatillos look like small green tomatoes encased in a papery husk. They're pleasantly tart, and principally used to make Mexican salsas, particularly salsa verde. They're good raw, but many cooks cook them briefly in order to enhance their flavor. Frozen tomatillos are good substitutes for fresh. Store fresh ones in the refrigerator for up to a month, or cook them and freeze them. Substitutes: green tomatoes + dash lemon juice OR plum tomatoes + dash lemon juice OR cape gooseberries
