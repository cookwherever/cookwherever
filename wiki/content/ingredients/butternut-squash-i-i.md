butternut squash     This variety is very popular because it's so easy to use.  It's small enough to serve a normal family without leftovers, and the rind is thin enough to peel off with a vegetable peeler.  As an added bonus, the flavor is sweet, moist, and pleasantly nutty.   Substitutes: buttercup squash (not as sweet and moist; harder to peel when raw; consider baking with skin on) OR acorn squash (not as sweet; harder to peel when raw, consider baking with skin on) OR calabaza OR delicata squash OR kabocha squash OR Hubbard squash (harder to peel when raw, consider baking with skin on) OR green papaya
