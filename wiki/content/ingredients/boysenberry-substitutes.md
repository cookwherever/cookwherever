boysenberry     A boysenberry is a cross between a blackberry, a raspberry, and a loganberry.  It's more fragile than a blackberry, but it also lacks the blackberry's conspicuous seeds.  Select boysenberries that are dark in color and free of mold.   Substitutes:  loganberry OR blackberry (This has larger, more noticeable seeds.) OR raspberry OR olallieberry OR dewberry OR youngberry
