bittersweet chocolate This is a sweetened chocolate that's heavy on the cocoa solids and light on the sugar, giving it a rich, intense chocolate flavor. Many pastry chefs prefer bittersweet to semi-sweet or sweet chocolate, but the three can be used interchangeably in most recipes. The best bittersweet chocolates contain at least 50% cocoa solids. Substitutes: semi-sweet chocolate (Very similar, but bittersweet chocolate usually has more chocolate liquor. To make semisweet chocolate more like bittersweet chocolate, add some unsweetened chocolate or cocoa powder to it.) OR sweet chocolate carob = St. John's bread = honey locust = locust bean CARE-ub Notes: Carob is sometimes used as a substitute by those unfortunates who are allergic to chocolate, since its flavor is vaguely similar. Others use it as a healthy alternative to chocolate, since it contains less fat and no caffeine. It's available as raw pods, chips, and either as toasted or untoasted powder (toasting helps bring out the flavor). Look for it in health food stores. Substitutes: cocoa powder (Most cookbooks call for cocoa to be substituted for carob measure for measure, but since cocoa has a stronger flavor, you should use less. Cocoa powder has more fat than carob powder, and some caffeine. Since carob burns more easily than cocoa, the recipe may call for a lower oven temperature than is necessary with cocoa powder.)
