golden nugget squash = Oriental pumpkin = gold nugget squash Notes: This has a pleasant flavor, but it doesn't have as much flesh as other squashes and the heavy rind makes it hard to cut before cooking. Select specimens that are heavy for their size, and that have a dull finish. Those with shiny rinds were probably picked too young, and won't be as sweet. Substitutes: acorn squash
