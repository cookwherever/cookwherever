acorn squash These are popular because of their small size--one squash can be cut in half and baked to make two generous servings. The biggest drawback to this variety is that the rind is quite hard, and therefore difficult to cut. Select acorn squash with as much green on the rind as possible. Substitutes: buttercup squash (drier) OR butternut squash (nuttier flavor; easier to peel when raw) OR banana squash (much larger) OR turban squash (sweeter) OR Hubbard squash (much larger) OR pumpkin (much larger) OR green papayas OR golden nuggest squash (hard to cut open; consider baking first)
