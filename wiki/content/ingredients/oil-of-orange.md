oil of orange This comes from orange peels, and is so concentrated that it's usually measured by the drop. Don't confuse it with orange extract, which is diluted with alcohol and not nearly as concentrated as the oil. Recipes for hard candies usually call for a flavoring oil rather than an extract, since extracts tend to evaporate when heated. Substitutes: orange extract (Extracts evaporate easily, and therefore can't withstand high heat or prolonged cooking. Four units of extract is roughly equivalent to one unit of flavoring oil, but this may vary according to the products used. Begin by substituting two units of extract per unit of flavoring oil, then add more extract until you're satisfied with the flavor.)
