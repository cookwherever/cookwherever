mango    The pulp from one large mango will yield one cup of pur�e.  It's always a challenge to eat a mango.  The pulp clings desperately to both peel and seed, and it usually turns into a mushy mess by the time you free it.  Despite this, the mango is one of the most popular fruits in the world.  It's sweet and juicy, and it has a wonderful, distinctive flavor.  Select richly colored, firm mangoes, then let them ripen at home for a few days.  Frozen mangoes are good substitutes for fresh.  peaches OR nectarines OR papayas
