safflower = Mexican saffron = saffron flower = American saffron Marketers often call safflower "saffron," but it bears little resemblance to the real thing, except that it imparts a weak, saffron-like color to food. It has very little flavor. Substitutes: saffron (use just a pinch; better flavor but more expensive) OR annatto seeds
