sunflower seeds Sunflower seeds are nutritious snacks. They're often sold in their shells, which you're supposed to crack open in your teeth and spit out after you've eaten the kernel within. Shelled sunflower seeds are also available for the more fastidious, and for cooks who want to add the seeds to breads, salads, casseroles, and trail mixes. Substitutes: pumpkin seeds OR peanuts (for snacking) OR pine nuts uda seeds Pronunciation: OO-duh Notes: Look for these in African markets.
