lablab bean = hyacinth bean = bonavist bean = Egyptian bean = Fuji mame = Indian bean = val These beans can be brown, reddish-brown, or cream colored, and they're easily identified by a white seed scar which runs along one edge. They have a pleasant nutty flavor, but they need to soaked and peeled before cooking. Skinned and split lablab beans, called val dal in Hindu, are more convenient to use. Both whole and split beans are available in Indian markets. Substitutions: black-eyed peas OR split peas
