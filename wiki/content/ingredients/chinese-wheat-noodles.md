Chinese wheat noodles = Chinese wheat starch noodles = ganmien These delicate noodles are mostly used in soups. They're available fresh, dried, or frozen, and they come in various sizes, some as thin as vermicelli, others as thick and wide as fettuccine. Before using, the Chinese boil the noodles (about 3-4 minutes for fresh, 5-10 for dried) and then rinse them in cold water. Substitutes: Chinese egg noodles (not as delicate) OR Japanese noodles (These usually cook faster than Chinese noodles. Don't stir-fry udon noodles--they're too soft.) OR crispy chow mein noodles (Americans often use these to make chow mein.) OR pasta rods (starchier) OR pasta ribbons (starchier) OR wonton noodles OR ramen OR rice
