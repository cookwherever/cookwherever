citrus peel, dried = fruit peel, dried To make your own: Begin with orange, lemon, tangerine, or grapefruit peels, scrape off and discard as much of the bitter white pith as possible, and dry what's left in the sun until hard. Substitutes: grated zest from a fresh peel (Fresh peels are better than dried peels since they have more aromatic oils.)
