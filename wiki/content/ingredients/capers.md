capers Notes: Capers are pickled flower buds, and very salty. You can get them pickled in brine (top photo) or salted (bottom). Look for them in the pickle section of your grocery store, or in delis. The smallest ones are more expensive, and more highly esteemed. Rinse them before using. Substitutes: pickled nasturtium seeds or buds (slightly different taste) OR chopped green olives OR brine-cured green peppercorns OR chopped dill pickles OR pickled seabeans
