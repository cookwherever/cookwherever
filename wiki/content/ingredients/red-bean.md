red bean = small red bean = Mexican red bean These are similar to red kidney beans, only smaller, rounder, and darker. In the Southwest, they're often used to make refried beans and chili. In Louisiana, they're used to make the classic red beans and rice. Substitutes: pinto bean (Good for making refried beans and chili.) OR red kidney bean (These are larger, but they're good for making red beans and rice.) OR azuki bean
