# Ingredients
Recipes are essentially just a collection of ingredients that are transformed through different [[techniques/_index|techniques]] to derive desirable qualities for us humans (or your pet if you want to play chef for them).

Ingredients have different purposes in recipes to help not just give us the nutrition we need, but also to make what we are eating interesting and something we want to have again.

Imagine a salad with wilted, pale leaves, who wants that?
