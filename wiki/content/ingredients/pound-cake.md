pound cake This is a rich buttery cake that's traditionally made with a pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. If you don't want to make one from scratch, you can find ready-made pound cakes among the frozen foods in your supermarket. Substitutes: butter cake (lighter texture) OR gï¿½noise (This absorbs flavors better than pound cake.)
