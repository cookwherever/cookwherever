Maraschino liqueur mare-uh-SKEE-noh Notes: This is an excellent semi-dry clear liqueur that's made with sour cherries. It's made from marasca cherries, which are native to Croatia. Unrest there has made good Maraschino liqueurs hard to find in recent years. Luxardo Maraschino and Stock Maraschino are well-respected brands. Substitutes: amaretto OR kirsch OR cherry liqueur (sweeter)
