parsnip Notes: These are like carrots, except that they're cream-colored and never served raw. Northern Europeans like to add them to stews, but they can also be purï¿½ed or served as a side dish. Choose small, crisp ones. Substitutes: carrot OR salsify OR turnip OR celeriac OR parsley root OR sweet potato
