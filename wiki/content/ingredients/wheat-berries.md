wheat berries = hard wheat berries = whole wheat berries Notes: These are wheat kernels that have been stripped only of their inedible outer hulls. They're nutritious, but they take hours to cook. If you don't have the patience to use the whole berries, try the more convenient cracked wheat, bulgur, or wheat flakes. Substitutes: kamut berries OR spelt berries OR soft wheat berries (softer and starchier) OR triticale berries OR cracked wheat OR bulgur
