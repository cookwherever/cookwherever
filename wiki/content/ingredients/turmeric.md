turmeric = fresh turmeric = Indian ginger = yellow ginger = mango ginger TUR-muhr-ik Shopping hints: Turmeric has a pungent flavor, but it's more widely known for it's brilliant yellow color. You can find fresh roots in Southeast Asian and Indian markets, but dried ground turmeric is far more commonly used. Be careful when handling fresh turmeric--it can stain your hands and clothes. Equivalents: 1 piece fresh turmeric = 1 teaspoon powdered turmeric. Substitutes: ground turmeric OR saffron (much more expensive, and more flavorful) OR Steep annatto seeds in boiling water for 20 minutes, then discard the seeds.
