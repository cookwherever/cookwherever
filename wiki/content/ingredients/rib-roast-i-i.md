rib roast     The entire rib section includes seven ribs, but it's usually cut into smaller chunks.  Each rib will feed about two people, so if you're feeding, say, six people, you should get a three-rib roast.  You can buy this cut as a standing rib roast, with the bones left in, or as a rolled rib roast, which is boned, then rolled and tied.  The nice thing about a standing rib roast is that it can stand by itself in the oven pan without a rack, plus the bones provide added flavor.  A large end rib roast  is cut from the part of the rib section nearest the chuck, so the steaks are bigger but tougher.  The small end rib roast = sirloin tip roast includes the ribs next to the choice loin section, so the meat's more tender and lean.  If the short ribs are lopped off of a rib roast, you get a half standing rib roast.   A steak cut from a rib roast is called a rib steak.     rib eye roast (similar, but boneless) OR veal rib roast (much less fat) OR top loin roast OR whole tenderloin (more tender and more expensive)
