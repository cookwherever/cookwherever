gypsy bacon   This Hungarian specialty consists of a slab of bacon that's been roasted and then seasoned with paprika.  It's then cut into thin slices and served on rye bread.  Look for it in German or Hungarian markets. Irish bacon = back bacon    This is a lot leaner than American bacon.  Note that Canadian bacon also is sometimes called back bacon.  Substitutes:   Canadian bacon OR pancetta OR regular bacon (consider blanching first to remove smoky flavor)
