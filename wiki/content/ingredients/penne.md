penne Pronunciation: PEH-neh Notes: This Italian pasta consists of short tubes cut on the diagonal, the better to scoop sauces inside. It's very versatile, and works well mixed with a sauce, or in a casserole, soup, or pasta salad. Penne rigate has ridges, the better to hold sauces. Penne lisce has smooth walls. Substitutes: mostaccioli (shorter, wider tubes) OR ziti (break into small pieces if in long form) OR rigatoni OR elbow macaroni (use 1/3 less if measuring by volume) OR elicoidali OR ditali OR fusilli
