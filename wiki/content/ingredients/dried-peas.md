Like beans, shelled peas are packed with both healthful nutrients and flatulence-producing enzymes. Since the water that you soak and cook the peas in absorbs some of the indigestible sugars that make you gassy, it helps to rinse the peas after soaking, and then use fresh water when you cook them. Split peas don't need to be soaked and cook quickly.
