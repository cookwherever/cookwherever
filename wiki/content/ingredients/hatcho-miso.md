hatcho miso = hat-cho miso = mame miso = mamemiso = dark miso HOT-choh MEE-soh Notes: This is a very strong, salty version of miso that's made with soybeans and aged for up to three years. It's reddish-brown, somewhat chunky, and often used to flavor hearty soups. Substitutes: red miso (made from barley instead of soybeans, not as pungent)
