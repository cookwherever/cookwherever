variety meats = offal (British) Variety meats is a catch-all term for the organ meats, feet, and tails of butchered animals. Earlier civilizations treated many of the organs as prized delicacies, and deservedly so since they're often as tender and mildly flavorful as the finest cuts of meat. They're fallen into disfavor in our times, though, which means that you can get many of these meats for a song. Refrigerate variety meats and use them within two days of purchase, or else freeze them.
