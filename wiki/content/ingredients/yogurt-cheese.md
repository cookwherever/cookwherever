yogurt cheese = chaka = labneh = lebna = labne = labanah This is a soft, tangy, and nutritious cream cheese substitute. To make your own: Line a colander with several folds of cheesecloth, a kitchen towel, or commercial yogurt strainer. Pour stabilizer-free yogurt into the cloth, then put the colander into a larger container, wrap with plastic, and let it drain overnight in the refrigerator until it's reduced to half its volume. If you like, add herbs or other flavorings. Substitutes: cream cheese (thicker consistency, not as tart, higher in calories) OR buttermilk cheese
