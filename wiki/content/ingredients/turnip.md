turnip Turnips can be roasted, boiled, steamed, or stir-fried. Select small turnips that feel heavy for their size. Substitutes: rutabaga (larger and sweeter than turnips; takes longer to cook) OR kohlrabi bulbs (similar flavor) OR black radish (more pungent) OR celeriac OR parsnip OR carrot OR salsify OR daikon
