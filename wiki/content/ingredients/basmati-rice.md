basmati rice bahs-MAH-tee Notes: This aromatic, long-grain rice is grown in the foothills of the Himalayas and is especially popular in India. The cooked grains are dry and fluffy, so they make a nice bed for curries and sauces. Basmati is available as either white or brown rice. Brown basmati has more fiber and a stronger flavor, but it takes twice as long to cook. Aged basmati rice is better, but more expensive. Equivalents: One cup dried rice yields three cups cooked rice. Substitutes: popcorn rice (slightly milder than basmati) OR jasmine rice ( has shorter grain than basmati, somewhat stickier; cooks slightly faster) OR long-grain rice (less expensive) OR wild pecan rice Bhutanese red rice Notes: This red short-grain rice is a staple in rural areas of Bhutan, a small kingdom nestled high in the Himalayas. It has a strong, nutty flavor and is best served with other assertive ingredients. It cooks much faster than brown rice. Substitutes: Wehani rice OR brown riceblack japonica rice
