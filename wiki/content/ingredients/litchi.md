litchi = lychee = lichee = lichi = leechee = laichee This popular Chinese fruit is about the size of a walnut, with a bumpy red shell encasing white translucent pulp that's similar in texture to a grape. The flavor is sweet, exotic, and very juicy. Don't eat the shell or the seed. Fresh litchis are available from May to July. If you can't find them, canned litchis are a good substitute. Don't confuse fresh litchis with litchi nuts, which are sun-dried litchis that have a much different texture. Substitutes: rambutans (slightly larger) OR longans (smaller and sweeter, but not as juicy) OR grapes
