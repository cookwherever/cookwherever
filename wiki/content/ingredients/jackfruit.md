jackfruit = jakfruit = jak = nankga This is the largest tree-borne fruit in the world--it weighs up to 100 pounds. It's hard to find fresh in the United States, but Asian markets sometimes stock canned jackfruit. The yellowish pulp tastes a bit like banana. The seeds can be boiled and eaten. Watch out for the sap--it can stain your clothes. Substitutes: breadfruit (smaller than jackfruit) OR papaya OR pineapple OR lychee
