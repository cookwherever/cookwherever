sloe gin  This liqueur is made by steeping sloe berries in gin.  Gordon's is a well-regarded brand.  Take one pound of washed sloes and prick their skins, then add 1/2 cup of sugar and one pint of gin.  Steep for several months, then gently strain without crushing the fruit.    Substitutes:   plum brandy
