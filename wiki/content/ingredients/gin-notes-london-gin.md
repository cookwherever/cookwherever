gin     JIN   Notes:   This is distilled from grains and similar to vodka except that it's flavored with juniper berries, herbs, peels, and spices.  London gin = dry gin = English gin = London dry     gin is the preferred gin for martinis and                                    other mixed drinks.  American gin  is similar, but isn't quite as heavy and dry as London gin.  Hollands gin = sweet gin = Dutch gin = Geneva gin = Jenever is sweeter and more aromatic than other gins and isn't normally used for mixed drinks.  Tanqueray and  Beefeater are well-respected brands.  Don't confuse gin with sloe gin, which is sweetened.   vodka (This turns a martini into a vodka martini, a gimlet into a vodka gimlet, a gin and tonic into a vodka and tonic, a Tom Collins into a vodka Collins, and so forth.) OR white rum OR whiskey OR tequila OR brandy (This turns an Alexander into a Brandy Alexander.)
