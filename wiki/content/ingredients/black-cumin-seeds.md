black cumin seeds = royal cumin seeds = kala jeera = shahi jeera = saah jeera KUH-min Notes: Indian cooks use this spice in many of their curries and tandoori dishes. It's darker and sweeter than ordinary cumin. To bring out its nutty flavor, it helps to toast the seeds briefly before using them. Substitutes: cumin (Not as sweet as black cumin.) OR nigella, black mustard seeds Notes: Indian cooks prefer these over the larger yellow mustard seeds that are more common in the west. Look for this in Indian markets or health food stores. Substitutes: brown mustard seeds (very close) OR yellow mustard seeds
