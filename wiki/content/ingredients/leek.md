leek Leeks look like large green onions, and they have a more complex onion flavor. They're often cooked as a vegetable side dish, or used in soups. Be sure to wash them thoroughly before cooking as the leaves are notorious for collecting dirt. Substitutes: yellow onion OR asparagus (as a side vegetable) OR ramps
