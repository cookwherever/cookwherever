brown lentil = Indian brown lentil = German lentil = green lentil = continental lentil = Egyptian lentil These are the standard khaki-colored lentils you see on grocery shelves everywhere. They tend to get mushy if overcooked. If you want them to be firm, add oil to the cooking water and cook the lentils just a short while, say 15 minutes. Substitutes: French green lentils (considered better) OR yellow lentils OR red lentils (smaller, take less time to cook)
