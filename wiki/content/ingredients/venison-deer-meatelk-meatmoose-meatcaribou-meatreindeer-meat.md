venison    The term venison applies todeer meat, elk meat, moose meat, caribou meat, and reindeer meat, all of which can be used interchangeably.   Venison is very lean, so it's important not to overcook it.  The best cuts are from the back strap, or loin area.   If you want to tone down the gamy flavor, marinate it in milk or add some vinegar to the sauce.   antelope meat OR beef (not as gamy or lean) OR bear
