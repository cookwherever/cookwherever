Cheddar     The curds of many English cheeses are "cheddared" or cut them into slabs and stacked to allow whey to drain off.  Some cheddars have more lactose in them, making them "sharp" or acidic.  Less sharp cheddars are often labeled "mild" or "medium."  England supplies many fine Cheddars, as does Vermont and Tillamook, Oregon.    Substitutes:  Colby OR Cheshire OR American cheese OR "Tofu Rella" Amber (a soy-based cheese substitute; use in melted cheese dishes) OR nutritional yeast OR white miso  OR  cheese substitutes Cheshire    CHESH-er  Notes:   Said to be England's oldest cheese, is a good cooking cheese.  Blue Cheshire is a blue-veined version.   Substitutes:  Cheddar OR  cheese substitutes
