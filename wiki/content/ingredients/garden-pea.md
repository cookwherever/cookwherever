garden pea = English pea = green pea = shell pea = fresh pea Equivalents: One pound unshelled yields one cup shelled. Notes: These appear in the summer months, and they're so sweet that it's well worth the trouble to shell them. Freshness is crucial, so look for brightly colored pods that are crisp enough to snap. Petits pois are a small and tender variety. Substitutes: edamame OR fresh lima beans
