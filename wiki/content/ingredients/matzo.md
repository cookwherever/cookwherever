matzo = matzoh MAT-suh Notes: This cracker is served during Passover to symbolize the unleavened bread the Jews ate during their hasty exodus from Egypt. To conform with Jewish dietary laws, matzo producers can't use leavening agents like baking soda or yeast. But they're still able to give the crackers a bit of airiness by baking them in extremely hot ovens, which causes trapped air bubbles in the dough to expand. Substitutes: cracker bread melba toast These thin, crisp slices of bread are often used as a base for appetizers or served with soups or salads. When crushed, they make an excellent breading for meat or fish. Substitutes: Cut French bread into very thin slices and bake at 400� for a few minutes until very dry and crisp. OR zwieback OR croutons OR water crackers pappadam = papad = poppadum = pappadom PAH-pah-dum Notes: These tortilla-shaped Indian crackers are made with chickpea or lentil flour. Before you serve them, you need to fry them in very hot oil or heat them in a microwave oven until they puff up and become crisp. You can then break them up and serve them with curried dishes, or use them like tortilla chips. They're sold in Indian markets. Substitutes: cracker bread OR shrimp chips
