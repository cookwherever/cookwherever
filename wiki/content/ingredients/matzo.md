matzo = matzoh MAT-suh Notes: This cracker is served during Passover to symbolize the unleavened bread the Jews ate during their hasty exodus from Egypt. To conform with Jewish dietary laws, matzo producers can't use leavening agents like baking soda or yeast. But they're still able to give the crackers a bit of airiness by baking them in extremely hot ovens, which causes trapped air bubbles in the dough to expand. Substitutes: cracker bread
