water caltrop = horned water chestnut = Jesuit nut = ling kio = ling chio = ling kok = ling jiao Trapa bicornis Notes: This black nut bears an unmistakable resemblance to a bull's head. Each one is about two inches across, and has a very hard shell. After you shell water caltrops, you'll need to steam or boil them before you can eat them as they contain harmful toxins in their raw state. Or you can skip eating them altogether, and just use them to make jewelry. Substitutes: water chestnuts (crunchier and sweeter)
