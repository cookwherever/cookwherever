cuttlefish = sepia This is a close relative of squid and octopus. You can sometimes find dried cuttlefish in Asian markets. Substitutes: squid (smaller and less tender, but otherwise a fairly close substitute) OR baby octopus OR octopus (A large octopus is much tougher than a cuttlefish, and needs to be tenderized before you cook it. Simmer it in salted water for 20 minutes before adding it to stews, soups, or sauces. Before saut�ing or grilling it, remove the suckers and ends of the legs and beat it with a mallet--or against some rocks, as they do in Greece.)
