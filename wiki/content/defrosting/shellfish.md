- It’s best to thaw shellfish until it’s just pliable.  There should be a few ice crystals in the flesh when you begin cooking it. 
- The refrigerator method is the best way to defrost shellfish, as long as you can do so without thawing it completely.  Many cooks recommend soaking shrimp in salt water (1-2 tablespoons salt per quart of water) while it’s thawing in the refrigerator.  
- The cold water method is the best way to defrost cooked shrimp or langostinos.   Unwrap them first.
- The cold water method is a good way to defrost uncooked shellfish. 
- The cook it frozen method is only a fair way to cook shellfish—it will be tougher and more rubbery than if you thawed it first.
- The room temperature method and the warm water method are unsafe ways to thaw shellfish.
