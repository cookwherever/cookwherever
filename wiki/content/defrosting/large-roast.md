#### How to defrost a large ham or roast:  
- The refrigerator method is best.  Allow 5 hours per pound.
- The cold water method is a good alterative.  Allow 30 minutes per pound.
- The cook it frozen method is a fairly good alternative, though you wonâ€™t be able to flour and brown the meat first.  Some cooks recommend boiling a frozen ham in orange or pineapple juice for about 30 minutes before baking it in the oven.  Allow up to half again as much time to cook frozen meat.   
- The microwave method is a poor way to thaw a large cut of meat, since the outside will start cooking while the inside is still frozen.  
- The room temperature method and the warm water method are unsafe ways to thaw meat.
