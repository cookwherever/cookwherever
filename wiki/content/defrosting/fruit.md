#### How to defrost fruit:  
- The refrigerator method is the best way to thaw frozen fruit.  Try not to thaw whole fruit (like berries) completely or it may turn mushy.  Time to defrost a pound of fruit:   6 - 8 hours if packed in syrup, longer if not.   
- The cold water method is a good alternative.  Keep the fruit wrapped in an airtight container and don’t thaw it completely—leave a few ice crystals.  Time to defrost a pound of fruit:  30 minutes if packed in syrup, longer if not.
