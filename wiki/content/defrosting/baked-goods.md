#### How to defrost baked goods:
- The refrigerator method is the best way to thaw most baked goods.  Keep them wrapped.
- The room temperature method is a very good alternative, and it’s faster than the refrigerator method.   Unwrap frosted cakes before thawing so that the frosting doesn’t stick to the wrapper.
- The cook it frozen method is another very good alternative for baked goods that can be served heated.  Larger items like loaves, muffins, or bagels can be thawed in a 350° oven for several minutes.  Baked cookies should be warmed in a 275° oven. 
- The microwave method is a good one for small, unfrosted baked goods like bagels and muffins.  It’s best to microwave them one at a time on high until they’re just thawed enough to cut in half (about 15 seconds), and then toast them briefly.  If you can’t toast them, microwave them until heated through, about 30 seconds.

> How to protect a frosted cake as it thaws:  You should keep a frosted cake wrapped while it’s thawing in the refrigerator so that it doesn’t absorb odors.  Since frosting likes to stick to plastic wrappers, keep the cake in an airtight plastic cake carrier or put it in a cardboard box and then wrap the box tightly with a clean plastic garbage bag.
