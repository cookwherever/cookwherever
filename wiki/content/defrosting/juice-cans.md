title: How to defrost concentrated juice cans
---
- The refrigerator method is the best way to defrost frozen juice cans. 
- The warm water method is a good alternative.  Submerge the can in warm water for a few minutes until the frozen juice is thawed enough to slide out of the can into a pitcher.  It sometimes helps to puncture the closed end of the can in order to break the vacuum.  Add some fresh water to the pitcher and mash the pulp with a potato masher.
