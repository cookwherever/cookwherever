title: How to defrost hamburger or small cuts of meat
---
- Be careful when cooking previously frozen hamburger—it sometimes looks brown on the inside even if it hasn’t been adequately cooked.  To be sure, use a meat thermometer to make sure that the internal temperature of the meat is at least 160°.
- The refrigerator method is the best way to thaw hamburger and small cuts of meat.  Since there’s less drip out, the meat will be juicier and more flavorful when cooked.  Allow 5 hours per pound.  After thawing, hamburger and poultry should be cooked within two days, beef and pork within five.
- The cold water method is a good alternative to the refrigerator method.
- The cook it frozen method is a good solution for hamburger patties and thin steaks.  Some chefs prefer it to the refrigerator method since it’s so easy to overcook fresh or thawed patties or thin steaks.    
- The microwave method is a fair way to thaw small cuts of meat.  The downside to this method is that the outside of the meat often starts to cook before the inside is fully thawed.  This makes it hard to sear the meat properly for optimal flavor and juiciness.  If several cuts are frozen together, take them out after a few minutes and pull them apart, then microwave them separately.  If you’re defrosting a block of hamburger, take it out of the microwave every few minutes to scrape away the thawed surface. 
- The cook it frozen method is a fair solution for cuts like chops, steaks and chicken.   If you’re grilling the meat, move the rack about 5 or 6 inches away from the heat source so that the outside of the meat doesn’t overcook; if you’re broiling it, move the rack about 4 or 5 inches away.  The downside to cooking frozen meat is that it doesn’t sear as well as it would if it were thawed, and that flour or breading doesn’t stick to it very well.  The meat also will take longer to cook.  
- The metal pan method is a poor way to defrost meat.  Don’t use this method if you think it will take longer than two hours for the meat to defrost. 
- The room temperature method and the warm water method are unsafe ways to thaw meat.

 >I’ve heard that you’re not supposed to leave meat out for more than 2 hours.  If I accidentally left a steak out for 4 hours, could I still eat it if I only had half? 

Once they get going, bacteria can grow at an exponential rate.   If a population of bacteria doubled every 30 minutes, for example, then each one of them would grow to 16 in two hours, and to 256 in four hours.  Throw the steak out.
