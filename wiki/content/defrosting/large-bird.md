- The refrigerator method is best.  Remove the neck and any giblets as soon as you can work them free.  A bird is fully thawed when there aren’t any more ice crystals in its cavity.   Allow 5 hours per pound.   Time to defrost a 15 pound turkey:  3 days
- If you forgot to put your bird in the refrigerator, the cold water method is a good alternative.  Be sure to change the water every 30 minutes.  Allow 30 minutes of thawing time per pound.   Time to defrost a 15 pound turkey:  7 - 8 hours
- If you’re short of time, the cook it frozen method is a fairly good solution.  If you’re roasting a frozen turkey, cook it at 350° instead of the 325° that most cookbooks recommend.  After a few hours, take it out of the oven briefly to extract the giblet bag.   A large bird will take up to 1½ times longer to roast than it would if it were fully thawed, and even longer if you stuff it or keeping opening the oven door to baste it.   The meat will be a bit drier than it would have been if you’d thawed it first.
- The microwave method is a poor way to thaw large items like turkeys and ducks—the wings would be fully cooked before you made much progress on the breasts.  If you must use this method, be sure to cook the bird as soon as it thaws—bacteria love partially cooked meats.
- The room temperature method and the warm water method are unsafe ways to thaw meat.
