#### How to defrost fish (see also:  defrosting shellfish):
- The cook it frozen method is the best way to thaw frozen fish, unless you plan to bread, stuff, or broil it.  Just pat the surface dry with a paper towel and cook it.  If it’s already breaded, there’s no need to thaw it.
- If you plan to bread, stuff, or broil fish, the refrigerator method is the best way to thaw it.  Try not to thaw it completely, though, since that will dry out the flesh.  To make the fish taste fresher, rinse it and let it soak in milk as it thaws.  Don’t rinse it again when you take it out of the refrigerator, just pat it dry and cook.  Time to defrost one pound of fish:  6-8 hours.
- The cold water method is a good way to thaw fish.  Don’t let the fish thaw completely.   Time to defrost one pound of fish:  1-2 hours.
- If several small fish are frozen together in a block, use the cold water method to separate them.  Cook them right away or wrap them and put them in the refrigerator to continue thawing. 
- The metal pan method is a fair way to defrost fish.  Definitely don’t do it for longer than 2 hours.
- The microwave method is a poor way to defrost fish. 
- The room temperature method and the warm water method are unsafe ways to thaw fish.
