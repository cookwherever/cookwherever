    "content": "Different seasons bring about different harvests of foods as they get to their peak ripeness and readiness to be eaten. Some foods are super delicate and immediately start to loose their flavor and appearance once they are picked (like [[corn]]).\n\nFoods that are shipped from around the world are often times picked before they are ready or transported in inert gas to attempt to preserve freshness or make them appear that they are ripe by the time they get to where they need to go. Doing this with food is nothing short of amazing, as a banana grown on a tree in South America can make its way up to Alaska, but it comes at a cost. Understanding how time and temperature affect the food you eat can completely change your view on what is considered \"fresh\" and what you should be looking for in an ingredient that you look for.\n\nKnowing when it is a good time to use foods that are \"in season\" will drastically change how what you cook turns out. \n\nHere is a nice [visualization](https://harvest.datasupply.co/) of different seasons in the US and what is harvested when.",
