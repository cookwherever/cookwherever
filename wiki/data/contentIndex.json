    "title": "acorn",
    "content": "acorn These nuts come from oak trees, and they were once an important food for Native Americans. Before they can be eaten, most acorns need to be treated to remove the bitter tannins in them. To do this, boil whole shelled acorns in water, replacing the water with fresh boiling water whenever it turns light brown. Keep doing this for about two hours, until the water no longer changes color. Alternatively, you can soak the shelled acorns in several changes of water for three or four days. Some Native Americans do this by putting whole or pounded acorns into nylon stockings and hanging them so that they're immersed in the water of a toilet tank (repeat: tank, not bowl). Each time the toilet is flushed, the water in the tank is refreshed. This may discolor the toilet, however. After the nuts have been leached of tannins, roast them in a 350ÔøΩ oven for about an hour. They can then be eaten whole or ground into acorn meal and used to make porridges or breads. Acorns from white oaks aren't nearly as bitter as those from red or black oaks, and can be roasted without first soaking them. Substitutes: hazelnuts (These are like acorns, only they're low in tannin.) OR chestnuts\n\n### Links\n\n* [[nuts]]",

It's largely displaced the fresh yeast our grandparents used since it has a longer shelf life and is more tolerant of mishandling. To activate it, sprinkle it on water that's 105ÔøΩ - 115ÔøΩ F and wait for it to begin foaming (about five minutes). Look for it in the dairy case--it's usually sold in strips of three packages or in 4-ounce jars. Always check the expiration date to make sure it's fresh. Dry yeast can be stored at room temperature until the expiration date--or within 4 months of opening--but it lasts even longer in the refrigerator or freezer. Always bring yeast to room temperature before you use it. It's important to keep stored yeast away from air and moisture, so use the smallest container you can find and seal it well. Substitutes: fresh yeast (Substitute one cake for each package or 2 1/4 teaspoons of active dry yeast.) OR instant yeast (Substitute measure for measure, but don't dissolve it in liquid first.

Like ordinary gelatin, agar is flavorless and becomes gelatinous when it's dissolved in water, heated, and then cooled. Agar, though, gels more firmly than gelatin, and it sets and melts at a higher temperature--it can even set at room temperature. Agar, like gelatin, is full of protein (though incomplete), but it also contains the rich array of minerals one would expect from seaweed. To use agar, just soak it in the liquid for about 15 minutes, bring it to a gentle boil, then simmer while stirring until it's completely dissolved. The liquid will gel as it cools. Acids weakens agar's gelling power, so if you're firming an acidic liquid, use more. Like gelatin, agar will break down if exposed to the enzymes of certain raw fruits, like kiwi fruit, papayas, pineapple, peaches, mangos, guavas, and figs. Cooking these fruits, though, destroys the enzymes. If you plan to add any of these fruits to a gelatin salad, it's a good idea to buy them in cans, since all canned fruit is pre-cooked. Agar comes in flakes, powder, or bars. Substitutes: gelatin (Substitute one tablespoon powdered gelatin for every tablespoon of powdered agar.

At most markets, you'll have to choose between two types of barley. Hulled barley is the most nutritious, since only the tough outer hulls are polished off. Pearl barley is polished some more, so that the outer bran layer is also scrubbed off.

Many brands were developed in the 1800s as elixirs that were supposed to cure indigestion, jaundice, and a variety of other ailments. Due to these \"medicinal\" properties, bitters allowed drinkers to avoid both liquor taxes and social stigma. The FDA put a stop to the medicinal claims in the early 1900s, and bitters quickly fell out of favor, except for a brief comeback during Prohibition. Today, they're used to flavor cocktails, coffee, and various dishes. Don't add more than a dash or two--bitters can easily overpower other flavors.

Others use it as a healthy alternative to chocolate, since it contains less fat and no caffeine. It's available as raw pods, chips, and either as toasted or untoasted powder (toasting helps bring out the flavor). Look for it in health food stores. Substitutes: cocoa powder (Most cookbooks call for cocoa to be substituted for carob measure for measure, but since cocoa has a stronger flavor, you should use less. Cocoa powder has more fat than carob powder, and some caffeine. Since carob burns more easily than cocoa, the recipe may call for a lower oven temperature than is necessary with cocoa powder.)\n\n### Links\n\n* [[chocolate]]",

Today, most brandy is distilled from white wine, though red wine and other fermented fruit juices are also used. It's then aged in oak barrels for several years. Brandy is often served as an after-dinner drink, or added to coffee. There are two highly regarded French brandies: Cognac and the slightly drier Armagnac. California also produces many fine brandies that are similar to cognac. Metaxa is a strong Greek brandy that tastes of resin. Spanish brandy is based on sherry, and is heavier and sweeter than French brandy. Apple brandy is distilled from apple cider, while pear brandy is made from pear cider. Fruit brandies are distilled from the fruit itself, instead of fruit juices.

Dry breadcrumbs are made from very dry bread, and make for a crispy, crunchy coating for fried foods.

It's more expensive but has a more pleasant flavor. You can also buy debittered brewer's yeast. Brewer's yeast comes powdered (the most potent form), in flakes (best for health shakes), and in tablets. Don't confuse this with active forms of yeast, like the kinds bakers, brewers, and winemakers use. If you eat them, active yeasts will continue to grow in your intestine, robbing your body of valuable nutrients.

OR shortening (This has an inferior flavor, and compared to butter it makes cookies crunchier and breads crusts softer.

In recent years, over-fishing in the Caspian Sea has greatly depleted sturgeon populations. Please consider using caviar and roe from more abundant species until the Caspian Sea sturgeon populations can recover. Malossol, or lightly salted caviar, is considered to be the highest quality. Caviar that doesn't make the malossol grade is used to make pressed caviar = payusnaya. Fresh caviar is considered much better than the pasteurized version. If substituting an inferior caviar, consider perking it up with a splash of fresh lemon juice. Equivalents: 2 tablespoons = 1 ounce Varieties: (from highest to lowest price) imperial caviar, beluga caviar, ossetra caviar, and sevruga caviar. Substitutes: hackleback roe (This black roe comes from American sturgeon. It's very delicate yet relatively inexpensive.) OR paddlefish roe (This gray roe also comes from American sturgeon. It resembles sevruga caviar but it's a lot cheaper.) OR salmon roe (This has large orange eggs and a bolder flavor than caviar.)

Unlike ordinary cornstarch, ClearJelÔøΩ works well with acidic ingredients, tolerates high temperatures, and doesn't cause pie fillings to \"weep\" during storage. ClearJelÔøΩ is an especially good choice if you're canning homemade pie fillings, since it doesn't begin thickening until the liquid begins to cool. This allows the heat the be more evenly distributed within the jar during processing. This is such an important safety advantage that ClearJelÔøΩ is the only thickener the USDA recommends for home canning. You can also use ClearJelÔøΩ to thicken sauces, stews, and the like, though it's a rather expensive all-purpose thickener. One downside is that products thickened with ClearJelÔøΩ tend to break down if they're frozen and thawed. If you plan to freeze what you're making, use Instant ClearJelÔøΩ, arrowroot, or tapioca starch. ClearJelÔøΩ is available either as pearls or powder from mail-order suppliers, but it's not yet available in grocery stores.

Don't do that yourself. Crooked rows taste just as good as straight, and keeping the husk on helps the corn stay sweet. Freshness is a better criterion, since the sugars in corn begin converting into starch the moment it's picked. The best test is to sample some kernels.

    "title": "cottage cheese",
    "content": "cottage cheese = smierkase Notes: This simple, mild cheese was traditionally produced in Europe's \"cottages\" from the milk left over from butter making. It's versatile, easy to digest, and a good source of protein. It's sold with either large or small curds, and with fruit or chives sometimes added. Use it within a few days after purchasing and discard if mold appears. It's best served chilled. To make your own: To make 2 cups (one pound), heat a gallon of skim milk to 80ÔøΩF (27ÔøΩC) using a double boiler (don't use aluminum or cast iron). Dissolve 1/4 tablet of rennet in a few tablespoons of cold water, then stir it into the milk using a whisk for a few minutes. Turn off the heat, cover, and let the mixture sit for about five hours at room temperature. Use a knife to cut the curds into half-inch cubes, then let them sit for about 15 minutes more. Put the double boiler on the stove and gradually bring the temperature of the cheese to 100ÔøΩF (38ÔøΩC) (it should take about 30 minutes to reach that temperature), and then up to 115ÔøΩF (46ÔøΩC) (this should take another 15 minutes). Hold it at this temperature for another 30 minutes. Be sure to raise the temperature gradually, or the curds will be hard and rubbery. Stir the mixture while it cooks, more if want small curds, less if you want big curds. Pour the mixture into a cheesecloth-lined colander and drain off the whey for a few minutes. Fill a sink with ice cold water. Pulling together the edges of the cheesecloth, dunk the curds in the water for a few minutes, then put the cheesecloth-wrapped curds back in the colander to drain. (Don't rinse the curds as long if you want your cottage cheese to have a sharper flavor.) If you like, stir in a teaspoon salt and 1/3 cup of cream, milk, or sour cream. Substitutes: ricotta (higher in fat) OR pot cheese (drier) OR fromage blanc (lower in fat) OR buttermilk cheese OR yogurt cheese OR tofu (firm silken) cream cheese = (in Europe) white cheese = queso crema Equivalents: 2 cups cream cheese = 1 pound Notes: An American favorite, cream cheese is a terrific spread for bagels and nut breads and a key ingredient in cheesecake and other desserts. It comes in low-fat and nonfat versions; these work well as spreads but compromise the flavor and texture of cheesecakes. Cream cheese made without stabilizers is also disappointing in cheesecakes, though it makes for a more acidic and flavorful spread. Store in the refrigerator. Unopened foil-wrapped commercial cream cheese is good for about a month after the \"Best when used by\" date on the carton. Once opened, you should use it within 10 days. Throw it out if mold appears. Substitutes: Neufch√¢tel (lower in fat and moister than regular cream cheese) OR equal parts ricotta and yogurt OR soy cream cheese OR tofu (use 3/4 cup tofu + 1/4 cup margarine + 1 tablespoon lemon juice to replace one cup cream cheese). OR yogurt cheese (usually lower in fat than cream cheese) OR buttermilk cheese (usually lower in fat than cream cheese) OR tofu cream cheese To make your own: Combine 2 cups milk and 2 cups whipping cream and heat the mixture in a double boiler (not aluminum or cast iron) until it's about 90ÔøΩF (32ÔøΩC). Remove from heat and stir in 2 tablespoons cultured buttermilk, cover, and let rest in a warm place for one or two days until it has the consistency of yogurt. Pour the mixture through a colander lined with butter muslin (or several layers of cheesecloth) and drain for several minutes. Replace the muslin or cheesecloth and nest the colander in a deep bowl, wrap tightly with plastic wrap, and put the bowl into the refrigerator and let it continue to drain for a day or so until the cream cheese has the desired consistency. Add salt to taste.\n\n### Links\n\n* [[fresh cheeses]]",

    "content": "Dried fruit is a terrific snack, but cooks also use it in everything from muffins to stews. Drying has the obvious advantage of letting us enjoy our favorite fruit when it's out of season, but it also serves to concentrate the fruit's flavor and sugar. Since high concentrations of sugar ward off bacteria, dried fruit can last up to a year without refrigeration. If you live in a hot, dry climate, you can dry fruit just by leaving it out in the sun for a few days. If not, you can use an oven or dehydrator. Sulfur dioxide is sometimes added to the fruit to improve its shelf life and color. If you're allergic to it, you can usually find unsulfured dried fruit at health food stores. In a pinch, you can remove some of the sulfur by boiling treated dried fruit for a minute or so, then draining off the liquid.\n\n### Links\n\n* [[apple, dried]]\n\n* [[apple, dried]]\n\n* [[apricot, dried turkish dried apricots]]\n\n* [[banana, dried]]\n\n* [[cantaloupe, dried]]\n\n* [[carrots, dried]]\n\n* [[cherry, dried]]\n\n* [[cherry, dried]]\n\n* [[chinese date]]\n\n* [[chinese date]]\n\n* [[chinese date]]\n\n* [[chinese date]]\n\n* [[chinese date]]\n\n* [[chinese date]]\n\n* [[chinese date]]\n\n* [[chinese date]]\n\n* [[chinese jujube chinese date.]]\n\n* [[chinese red date chinese date.]]\n\n* [[citrus peel, dried]]\n\n* [[coconut, grated]]\n\n* [[coconut, grated]]\n\n* [[craisins cranberries, dried.]]\n\n* [[cranberries, dried]]\n\n* [[cranberries, dried]]\n\n* [[cranberries, dried]]\n\n* [[cranberries, dried]]\n\n* [[currant]]\n\n* [[currant]]\n\n* [[currants]]\n\n* [[date, dried]]\n\n* [[dried apricot paste]]\n\n* [[fig, dried]]\n\n* [[ghora angur]]\n\n* [[golden raisin]]\n\n* [[golden raisin]]\n\n* [[golden raisinsmuscat raisinscurrants]]\n\n* [[jujube chinese date.]]\n\n* [[kokum]]\n\n* [[kokum]]\n\n* [[leechee nut litchi nut.]]\n\n* [[lichee nut litchi nut.]]\n\n* [[lichi nut litchi nut.]]\n\n* [[litchi nut]]\n\n* [[litchi nut]]\n\n* [[litchi nut]]\n\n* [[litchi nut]]\n\n* [[litchi nut]]\n\n* [[lychee nut litchi nut.]]\n\n* [[mango, dried]]\n\n* [[mango, dried]]\n\n* [[mulberries, dried]]\n\n* [[muscat raisins]]\n\n* [[nectarines, dried]]\n\n* [[nectarines, dried]]\n\n* [[papaya, dried]]\n\n* [[peach, dried]]\n\n* [[peach, dried]]\n\n* [[pear, dried]]\n\n* [[persimmon, dried]]\n\n* [[pineapple, dried]]\n\n* [[pineapple, dried]]\n\n* [[plum, dried prune.]]\n\n* [[prune]]\n\n* [[prune]]\n\n* [[prune]]\n\n* [[raisins]]\n\n* [[red date chinese date.]]\n\n* [[senjed chinese date.]]\n\n* [[somagh]]\n\n* [[sour prunes]]\n\n* [[substitutes:]]\n\n* [[sumac berries]]\n\n* [[sumac berries]]\n\n* [[sun-dried tomatoes]]\n\n* [[zante currants currant.]]\n\n* [[zante raisins currant.]]",

There are ways to enjoy beans without having to forego social appointments, however. One is to change the water from time to time while you're soaking or cooking the beans. Pouring off the water helps gets rid of the indigestible complex sugars that create gas in your intestine. It also helps to cook the beans thoroughly, until they can be easily mashed with a fork. Most bean aficionados prefer dried beans, but canned beans are also available.

Sweet onions are usually served raw or lightly cooked. Onions should be firm and heavy for their size. Avoid onions that have sprouted or that have an odor, or that have green or moldy blemishes. If you're prone to crying while cutting onions, try chilling them first, then peeling them under running water.

To prevent the yolks from coagulating, you need to keep the sauce below 190ÔøΩ, although this rule can be broken if the sauce has a lot of flour in it. Finally, never cook sauces with egg yolks in aluminum pans or they'll turn gray.\n\n### Links\n\n* [[thickeners]]",

    "title": "evaporated milk",
    "content": "evaporated milk = condensed milk = concentrated milk This is sold in cans, and comes either whole or nonfat. Don't confuse it with sweetened condensed milk, which has lots of sugar and is not a good substitute. While evaporated milk is sometimes called condensed milk, most recipes that call for condensed milk are referring to sweetened condensed milk. Evaporated milk is sold with varying amounts of butterfat, ranging from whole evaporated milk with about 8% to skim evaporated milk with about 0.5%. To reconstitute evaporated milk, combine it with an equal amount of water. Substitutes: half \u0026 half OR milnot (available in Britain; whips better than evaporated milk) OR cream (higher in fat, but works well in pumpkin pies) See also: milk goat's milk This comes with varying percentages of butterfat. You can buy it fresh, or as powdered milk, canned evaporated milk, or UHT milk packed in aseptic containers. Fresh is best for drinking and delicate desserts, the other kinds pick up an unpleasant caramelized flavor when they're heated for packaging. Substitutes: cow's milk (This is less expensive and milder-tasting, but harder to digest than goat's milk.) OR oat milk (This is more expensive and less nutritious, but a good all-purpose substitute for milk in cooking. This is a good choice for vegetarians who object to the animal exploitation involved in the production of goat's or cow's milk.) OR buttermilk (Especially good in pancakes or waffles. If using in baked goods, 1C milk = 1 C buttermilk - 2 teaspoons baking powder + 1/2 teaspoon baking soda) OR soy milk (This is more expensive and, unless fortified, less nutritious than goat's milk. It has a nutty flavor and turns beige when cooked. It works well in most baked goods, but it's a risky substitute in savory dishes.) OR rice milk (This is more expensive and, unless fortified, less nutritious. It's great for making desserts, but it's too sweet for savory dishes) OR almond milk (This is also more expensive and, unless fortified, less nutritious. It's very sweet, so use it in desserts only) OR water (This makes eggs creamier in scrambled eggs and gives breads a coarser texture and a lighter crust.) half-and-half = half \u0026 half (10.5 - 18% fat) Substitutes: equal parts cream and milk OR evaporated milk OR 7/8 C milk + 1 ¬Ω tablespoons butter or margarine heavy cream = heavy whipping cream (at least 36% fat) Substitutes: creme fraiche (for making cream sauces) OR 1 C heavy cream = ¬æ C milk + 1/3 C butter (will not whip) OR light cream (will not whip) OR evaporated milk (especially in cream sauces) OR milk (will not whip; makes cream sauces much less flavorful) OR blend equal parts milk and cottage cheese (Warning: Substituting light cream or milk for heavy cream lowers the amount of fat in a dish, but it makes ice cream and sauces less rich and creamy.) OR pureed cottage cheese OR pureed ricotta cheese OR silken tofu (especially for ice cream--for directions, see the Tofu Ice Cream recipe posted by Veggie Unite!) Notes: Unlike heavy cream, lower-fat substitutes like half-and-half and evaporated milk tend to \"break\" or curdle when added to sauces. To prevent this from happening, heat the sauce over low or medium heat, or reduce the cream substitute before adding it to the sauce. Don't let the sauce boil. Cream sauces made with lower-fat cream substitutes also tend to have less body; to correct for that, consider adding 1 tablespoon flour or 2 teaspoons cornstarch to the sauce for every cup of evaporated milk substituted. Stir the thickener into a paste first to prevent lumps. Ultra-pasteurized whipping cream is harder to whip and has some unpleasant flavor notes.\n\n### Links\n\n* [[milk \u0026 cream]]",

To do so, place the tofu on several layers of paper towels or cheesecloth, cover it with plastic wrap, and put something heavy on it. Do this for at least an hour, or put the whole assembly in a pan and set it in the refrigerator overnight. Store tofu in the refrigerator, changing the water daily, and use it within a week.

The curds that remain are molded into cheese. Fresh cheeses tend to be bland, so they're often used as vehicles for other flavorings. Some, like cream cheese, are used to make dips or cheesecakes. Others, like ricotta cheese, are used as fillings for dumplings, pasta, crepes, or pastries. Still others, like cottage cheese, can be a meal all by themselves once they're perked up with herbs, fruit, or other flavorings. , Fresh cheeses have a higher moisture content and are usually lower in fat and sodium than other cheeses. Most are highly perishable, so check the expiration date when you buy them and keep them tightly wrapped or covered in the refrigerator. Moist fresh cheeses like cottage cheese and ricotta should be eaten within a week of purchase; firmer cheeses like cream cheese and farmer's cheese can usually be stored for about two weeks. Don't eat fresh cheese if mold appears on it. , Tips: , Fresh cheese work best in cold dishes., Fresh cheeses tend to break when added to hot sauces, so add them at the last minute., Lactose-intolerant people may prefer aged cheese over fresh, since aged cheese contains less lactose. ,\n\n### Links\n\n* [[fresh cheeses]]",

When reheated, say in your mouth, the gel melts. Most of us know gelatin as the key ingredient in the quivering dessert we call Jell-OÔøΩ, but cooks also use it to make cheesecakes, mousses, marshmallows, meringues, chiffon pies, ice cream, nougats, aspics, and many other things. Gelatin will break down if exposed to the enzymes of certain raw fruits, like kiwi fruit, papayas, pineapple, peaches, mangos, guavas, and figs. Cooking these fruits, though, destroys the enzymes. If you plan to add these fruits to a gelatin salad, it's often easiest to buy them in cans, for all canned fruit is pre-cooked. Gelatin is made from the bones, skins, hooves, and connective tissue of animals, including pigs, so it's objectionable to vegetarians and members of certain religions. Kosher gelatins are available, and some of these are also vegetarian. Substitutes: agar (A good choice for vegetarians.) OR guar gum OR carrageen OR arrowroot\n\n### Links\n\n* [[gelatins]]",

Food gurus are always saying that cooks should never, ever use imitation vanilla extract, but at least one taste test has shown that many people prefer a high quality imitation vanilla extract to pure extract.

Sure they're a bit bland, but they're high in nutrients, low in fat, and dirt cheap. , Cooks usually consign grains to supporting roles, letting them absorb the flavors of other ingredients while adding texture and body. It often helps to toast grains briefly before cooking them so as to bring out the flavor and speed up the cooking time., Most grains have been processed by the time they reach us. The first step at the mill is to remove the inedible outer hull, yielding what's called a whole grain, berry, or groat. Whole grains are nutritious, but they're chewy and slow to cook. To fix that, the nutritious bran layer beneath the hull is sometimes scoured off as well, resulting in a pearled or polished grain. Whole or polished grains are then sometimes ground, rolled, or chopped into flakes, small grits, meal, or flour.\n\n### Links\n\n* [[grains category]]",

Notes: Unlike heavy cream, lower-fat substitutes like half-and-half and evaporated milk tend to \"break\" or curdle when added to sauces. To prevent this from happening, heat the sauce over low or medium heat, or reduce the cream substitute before adding it to the sauce. Don't let the sauce boil. Cream sauces made with lower-fat cream substitutes also tend to have less body; to correct for that, consider adding 1 tablespoon flour or 2 teaspoons cornstarch to the sauce for every cup of evaporated milk substituted.

Substitutes: See RecipeSource postings for Mock Hollandaise Sauce or Mock Hollandaise Sauce (low cholesterol). horseradish (prepared) This pungent condiment goes well with meats and fish, and itÔøΩs a key ingredient in cocktail sauce. ItÔøΩs best to buy horseradish in small amounts and store it in the refrigeratorÔøΩit turns dark and loses much of its bite after a few months. Look for it in the deli case. Varieties: The most common is white horseradish, which is made with vinegar. Creamed horseradish = cream-style horseradish has a little mayonnaise and/or sour cream added; horseradish sauce has a lot. Red horseradish = beet horseradish is made with beet juice. To make your own: When exposed to air, the flesh of the horseradish root begins an enzymatic reaction that causes it to become increasingly pungent within the first few minutes, and then milder after that. Adding a sour liquid stops the reaction and locks in the heat for several months. If youÔøΩre making your own white horseradish, make sure your kitchen is well ventilated, wear rubber gloves, and avoid touching your eyes. Begin by preparing a sour liquid solution of one cup vinegar and one teaspoon salt. Next, peel a horseradish root, chop it into small pieces, and grind it in a blender, adding just enough water to enable the blade to turn freely. To make a mild sauce, immediately mix in ÔøΩ cup of the vinegar solution for each cup of grated horseradish root. To make the sauce hotter, add the solution after a few minutes when the pungency is peaking. Refrigerate or freeze until ready to use. Substitutes: grated horseradish root OR wasabi (This Japanese condiment comes in green paste or powder.) OR wasabi cream sauce OR grated wasabi root (This is hard to find in American markets.)\n\n### Links\n\n* [[european condiments]]",

There are over 300 kinds of honey, most of them named after the principal nectar source (e.g., clover honey, eucalyptus honey). These varieties range in color from almost white to amber to dark brown. As a rule of thumb, the lighter the color of the honey, the milder the flavor. Alfalfa honey is a very popular light and mild honey, great for baking or table use. Basswood honey is light in color, but it has a fairly strong flavor. Buckwheat honey is very dark and bold-flavored, so it's not well suited to baking. Clover honey is America's most popular honey, very mild and fine-flavored. Eucalyptus honey, popular in Australia, has a somewhat bold and slightly medicinal flavor. Orange blossom honey is an excellent, mild honey with a delicate flowery flavor. Sage honey is almost white in color, with a mild flavor. Tulip poplar honey is dark, yet mild-tasting. Tupelo honey is highly prized for its distinctive mild flavor; it's also relatively expensive.

    "content": "kosher salt Notes: This salt was developed for the preparation of kosher meats, but many cooks prefer it over table salt. It has coarser grains, so it's easier to use if you, like professional chefs, toss salt into pots with your fingers, measuring by touch. Most kosher salt is also flaked, giving each grain a larger surface area. This helps the salt adhere better, so it's great for lining margarita glasses, and for making a salt crust on meats or fish. Kosher salt also is preferred over table salt for canning and pickling. Like pickling salt, kosher salt is free of iodine, which can react adversely with certain foods. Some brands of kosher salt contain yellow prussiate of soda, an anti-caking agent, but unlike the anti-caking additive in table salt, it doesn't cloud pickling liquids. The only drawback to using kosher salt for pickling or canning is that the grains are coarser and flakier, and can't be packed as tightly into a measuring cup as pickling salt. This raises the risk that the salt won't be properly measured. To get around this problem, measure by weight instead of volume. With its large grains, kosher salt isn't a good choice for baking. Look for boxes of it in the spice section of your supermarket. Substitutes: pickling salt OR Margarita salt OR table salt (smaller grains, use half as much; doesn't cling as well to food; iodized salt can cause pickles to cloud.)\n\n### Links\n\n* [[salt]]",

Substitutes: fresh lima beans OR fava beans (more flavorful) OR soybeans\n\n### Links\n\n* [[dry beans]]",

Diastatic malt contains active enzymes which help break starch down into sugar. The extra sugar feeds the yeast in the dough, helping the bread to rise, and also gives the bread a browner crust. It's often used to make crusty breads. Non-diastatic malt doesn't have active enzymes, but it gives baked goods better flavor and a shinier, browner crust. It's used in everything from bagels to croissants to breakfast cereals.

There are hundreds of varieties of miso, and the Japanese match them to dishes with the same care that Americans match wines to meals. The darker kinds are saltier and more pungent, the lighter are sweeter and milder. Always add miso to soups and stews at the end, since boiling it destroys beneficial bacteria and causes it to curdle. Look for tubs of miso in the refrigerated section of Japanese food markets, health foods stores, or large supermarkets. It will keep in your refrigerator for many months.

Molasses is the thick, syrupy residue that's left behind in the vats. It has a sweet, distinctive flavor, and it's a traditional ingredient in such things as gingerbread, baked beans, rye bread, and shoofly pie. There are several different varieties. Light molasses = sweet molasses = mild molasses = Barbados molasses is taken from the first boiling. It's the sweetest and mildest, and is often used as a pancake syrup or a sweetener for beverages. Dark molasses = full molasses = full-flavored molasses is left behind after the juices are boiled a second time. It's less sweet but more flavorful than light molasses, and it's a good choice if a recipe simply calls for molasses. Blackstrap molasses comes from the third and final boiling. It's too strong and bitter for most recipes, and it's mostly consumed for its alleged nutritional benefits. Most of the molasses sold in supermarkets is unsulfured. Sulfured molasses has sulfur dioxide added as a preservative, and isn't as mild and sweet as unsulfured molasses. Food grade molasses is almost always made from sugar cane. Sugar beet molasses is very bitter and is mostly used as cattle feed or as a medium for growing yeast. When measuring molasses, grease the cup and utensils to keep molasses from sticking. If your molasses crystallizes while being stored, heat it gently to dissolve the crystals. After opening, you can store molasses in your cupboard.

Substitutes: Fontina OR Havarti OR Esrom mozzarella Pronunciation: mah-tsuh-REHL-uh Notes: Mozzarella is one of the few cheeses that doesn't turn rubbery or ooze oil if cooked too long or too hot, so it's a key ingredient in pizzas and casseroles. It's also stretchy--the long white strings that you often see draped over the sides of pizza boxes are usually mozzarella. There are two kinds. Low moisture mozzarella is firmer and the best choice for pizza. High moisture mozzarella = fresh mozzarella is more delicate; it's often drizzled with olive oil and serve uncooked as an appetizer. It works in pizza, too, but you should first put slices of it into a colander to drain for about an hour, and put them on the pizza only during the last minute of cooking. High moisture mozzarella is often packaged in tubs or bags filled with water--this keeps it soft but leeches out some of the flavor. Look for mozzarella di bufalo = buffalo milk mozzarella, which is more interesting than cow's milk mozzarella = fior di latte. Bocconcini (Pronunciation: BOK-kuhn-CHEE-nee) are small balls of high moisture mozzarella. High moisture mozzarellas are much more perishable than their low-moisture counterparts, so use them within a few days of purchase.

Be careful when picking wild mushrooms--some species are poisonous--and always cook them thoroughly, both to release their flavors and to convert their proteins into a more usable form. To prepare fresh mushrooms, first trim off the bottoms of the stems, then wipe them off. Don't rinse them or soak them, for they'll absorb water and turn mushy when you cook them. Dried mushrooms are often excellent substitutes for fresh, though some species don't dry well. You can reconstitute dried mushrooms by soaking or simmering them. Don't throw out the soaking liquid--it can add more flavor to your sauce than the mushrooms themselves. You can also pulverize dried mushrooms with a food processor or blender, then use the mushroom powder to flavor sauces and stews.\n\n### Links\n\n* [[]]\n\n* [[abalone cap mushroom]]\n\n* [[bear's head mushroom]]\n\n* [[black forest mushroom]]\n\n* [[black forest mushroom]]\n\n* [[black mushroom]]\n\n* [[black mushroom]]\n\n* [[black trumpet mushroom]]\n\n* [[black winter mushroom]]\n\n* [[black winter mushroom]]\n\n* [[blewit mushrooms]]\n\n* [[bolete]]\n\n* [[bolete]]\n\n* [[borowik]]\n\n* [[borowik]]\n\n* [[brown mushroom]]\n\n* [[brown mushroom]]\n\n* [[brown oak mushroom]]\n\n* [[brown oak mushroom]]\n\n* [[button mushroom]]\n\n* [[button mushroom]]\n\n* [[cauliflower mushroom]]\n\n* [[chinese black mushroom]]\n\n* [[chinese black mushroom]]\n\n* [[cinnamon cap mushroom]]\n\n* [[cremini mushroom]]\n\n* [[egg mushroom]]\n\n* [[egg mushroom]]\n\n* [[enok]]\n\n* [[enok]]\n\n* [[enoki mushroom]]\n\n* [[enokidake]]\n\n* [[enokidake]]\n\n* [[enokitake]]\n\n* [[enokitake]]\n\n* [[equivalents:]]\n\n* [[eryngii mushroom]]\n\n* [[fairy-ring mushroom]]\n\n* [[forest mushroom]]\n\n* [[forest mushroom]]\n\n* [[funnel chanterelle]]\n\n* [[funnel chanterelle]]\n\n* [[gamboni mushroom]]\n\n* [[girole]]\n\n* [[girole]]\n\n* [[golden chanterelle]]\n\n* [[golden chanterelle]]\n\n* [[golden mushroom]]\n\n* [[golden mushroom]]\n\n* [[golden needle mushroom]]\n\n* [[golden needle mushroom]]\n\n* [[golden oak mushroom]]\n\n* [[golden oak mushroom]]\n\n* [[hawk's wing mushroom]]\n\n* [[hedgehog mushroom]]\n\n* [[honey mushroom]]\n\n* [[huitlacoche]]\n\n* [[italian brown mushroom]]\n\n* [[italian brown mushroom]]\n\n* [[italian mushroom]]\n\n* [[italian mushroom]]\n\n* [[king bolete]]\n\n* [[king bolete]]\n\n* [[lobster mushroom]]\n\n* [[mo-er mushroom]]\n\n* [[mo-er mushroom]]\n\n* [[morels]]\n\n* [[nameko mushroom]]\n\n* [[oriental black mushroom]]\n\n* [[oriental black mushroom]]\n\n* [[oyster mushroom]]\n\n* [[paddy straw mushroom]]\n\n* [[paddy straw mushroom]]\n\n* [[pfifferling]]\n\n* [[pfifferling]]\n\n* [[pine mushroom]]\n\n* [[pine mushroom]]\n\n* [[pleurotte]]\n\n* [[pleurotte]]\n\n* [[pleurotus mushroom]]\n\n* [[pleurotus mushroom]]\n\n* [[polish mushroom]]\n\n* [[polish mushroom]]\n\n* [[pom pom mushroom]]\n\n* [[porcino]]\n\n* [[portobello mushroom]]\n\n* [[puff ball mushroom]]\n\n* [[shiitake mushroom]]\n\n* [[shitake mushroom]]\n\n* [[shitake mushroom]]\n\n* [[silver ear mushroom]]\n\n* [[snow mushroom]]\n\n* [[snow mushroom]]\n\n* [[snow puff mushroom]]\n\n* [[snow puff mushroom]]\n\n* [[st. george's mushroom]]\n\n* [[steinpilze]]\n\n* [[steinpilze]]\n\n* [[stensopp]]\n\n* [[stensopp]]\n\n* [[straw mushrooms]]\n\n* [[sweet tooth mushroom]]\n\n* [[sweet tooth mushroom]]\n\n* [[tree ear mushroom wood ear mushroom.]]\n\n* [[tree oyster mushroom]]\n\n* [[tree oyster mushroom]]\n\n* [[truffles]]\n\n* [[velvet foot mushroom]]\n\n* [[velvet foot mushroom]]\n\n* [[velvet stem mushroom]]\n\n* [[velvet stem mushroom]]\n\n* [[white button mushroom]]\n\n* [[white button mushroom]]\n\n* [[white chanterelle mushroom]]\n\n* [[white fungus]]\n\n* [[white fungus]]\n\n* [[white jelly fungus]]\n\n* [[white jelly fungus]]\n\n* [[white mushroom]]\n\n* [[white tree fungus]]\n\n* [[white tree fungus]]\n\n* [[winecap mushroom]]\n\n* [[winter chanterelle]]\n\n* [[winter chanterelle]]\n\n* [[winter mushroom]]\n\n* [[winter mushroom]]\n\n* [[wood ear mushroom]]\n\n* [[yellow chanterelle]]\n\n* [[yellow chanterelle]]\n\n* [[yellow foot chanterelle]]\n\n* [[yellow foot chanterelle]]\n\n* [[yellow foot mushroom]]",

Unfortunately, tree-ripened nectarines bruise easily, so most growers scrimp on flavor and pick and market them while they're still slightly underripe. After buying nectarines, you're supposed to let them ripen for a couple of days at room temperature before eating them. This makes them softer and juicier, but not sweeter. Avoid buying nectarines that are too hard or that have green spots--a sign they were picked way too soon--or those that are bruised. The superior freestone varieties arrive in June and July; the cling varieties that come later aren't as good. Substitutes: peaches (not as sweet) OR apricots peach Most of the peaches that are sold in markets are freestone, and de-fuzzed by the grower. Select peaches that are colorful and free of bruises.

They're more perishable than other potatoes, so use them within a few days after buying them. Substitutes: Larger boiling potatoes, cut into smaller cubes\n\n### Links\n\n* [[potatoes]]",

You can also use a food processor fitted with a steel blade to do this, but it's hard to keep the nut meal from turning into nut butter.

It comes in flakes or powder and is popular with vegans and health buffs who use it to make cheese substitutes, gravies, and many other dishes. It's also a great topping for popcorn. Nutritional yeast is very similar to brewer's yeast, which is also used as a nutritional supplement and is made from the same strain of yeast. The difference is that brewer's yeast is a by-product of beer production and retains some of the bitter flavor of hops. Don't confuse nutritional yeast, which is deactivated, with active forms of yeast, like the kinds bakers, brewers, and winemakers use. If you eat them, active yeasts will continue to grow in your intestine, robbing your body of valuable nutrients. Look for nutritional yeast at health food stores. Get fortified nutritional yeast if you're taking it as a source of vitamin B12.

Raw olives must be cured before they can be eaten, and the curing medium--usually lye, brine, or salt--affects their flavor and texture. So too does the olive's degree of ripeness when it's picked. Green olives are picked while unripe, which makes them denser and more bitter than brown or black olives, which stay on the tree until fully ripened. Olives become bitter if they're cooked too long, so always add them to hot dishes at the last minute.

Many people have sworn off persimmons for life after biting into an underripe, astringent Hachiya. But if you wait until it's ripened to a soft, shriveled mess, you can spoon out its exquisitely sweet and delicate pulp. Fuyus aren't as flavorful, but they're more idiot-proof in that you can eat them while they're still firm and not get your mouth in a pucker. Substitutes: plums OR pumpkin (Mashed pumpkin is a good substitute for persimmons in many baked good recipes.) pineapple Pineapples are juicy, mildly acidic, and very versatile. They can be squeezed for juice, sliced on cakes, skewered and grilled, or eaten raw without adornment. Select only ripe pineapples; they stop becoming sweeter once they're picked. A new variety, the golden pineapple, is sweeter, juicier, and richer in vitamin C than ordinary pineapples. A white pineapple also has been developed. Canned pineapple is an acceptable substitute for fresh in many recipes. Substitutes: papaya (Like a pineapple, it holds its shape when cooked.) pomegranate = Chinese apple Cut through the pomegranate's leathery skin, and you'll find hundreds of pretty kernels, each with a tiny seed surrounded by ruby red pulp. You can eat the kernels, seeds and all, and they're great as garnishes or sprinkled in salads. You can also press the kernels for juice and strain out the seeds.

Waxed paper doesn't adhere well to food or containers and will let air in and steam out.) OR aluminum foil (Foil insulates food, making it slow to freeze or thaw. Aluminum also reacts with salty or acidic foods, diminishing flavor or appearance.),\n\n### Links\n\n* [[food wrappers]]",

    "content": "pasta PAH-stuh Equivalents: One pound dried pasta yields the same amount of cooked pasta as 1 1/2 pounds fresh pasta. Notes: A staple of Italian cuisine, pasta is made with a dough that's kneaded and then fashioned into hundreds of different shapes and sizes. The tiniest shapes are often used in soups, long ribbons or strands with sauces, and tubes and fanciful shapes in casseroles and pasta salads. Some shapes are large enough to be stuffed and baked, and others, like ravioli, come already stuffed. Most pasta is made with semolina, a hard wheat flour, but some producers use corn, rice, spelt, and kamut. These alternative grains yield a mushier pasta, but they're a boon to people with wheat allergies.\n\n### Tips\n* Recipes that call for pasta usually intend for you to use dried pasta, since sauces cling to it better.\n* The best dried pasta is made from 100% durum wheat semolina, and has a rough surface, the better to absorb sauces.\n* Fresh pasta absorbs flavors and works best with cream or cheese sauces. It cooks faster than dried pasta.\n* Use lots of water when cooking pasta, at least a gallon per pound. You can add salt to the water if you wish, but don't add oil. Bring the water to a rolling boil before adding the pasta. When the water returns to a boil, lower the heat to maintain a low boil. Stir occasionally to keep the pasta from sticking together. Don't cover the pot.\n* Pasta is ready when it's \"al dente.\" It should be cooked completely through, yet firm enough to offer some resistance to your bite.\n* Drain the pasta in a colander, but don't rinse it unless you plan to use it in a casserole or pasta salad. Reserve a small amount of the flavorful cooking liquid in case the pasta becomes too dry and needs to be moistened. Serve it as soon as possible.\n* For pasta salads, select short, thick tubes or shapes of dried pasta for pasta salad. Don't use egg pasta or fresh pasta.\n* For casseroles, select tubes with thick walls or sturdy shapes. Cook them for two-thirds of the recommended time in water, then let them finish cooking in the oven.\n* Different kinds of pasta cook at different rates, so select shapes of similar sizes if you're combining them.\n* If you use a low-quality pasta, be sure to cook it in plenty of water to prevent it from getting gummy.\n* Don't freeze cooked pasta unless it's in a baked casserole.\n* Many pasta shapes comes in different sizes. The Italian suffix \"ini\" means smaller (e.g., spaghettini is a thin version of spaghetti), while \"oni\" means larger.\n\n### Substitutes\n\n\n### Links\n\n* [[]]\n\n* [[]]\n\n* [[black pasta]]\n\n* [[corn pasta]]\n\n* [[dried pasta]]\n\n* [[egg pasta]]\n\n* [[flavored pasta]]\n\n* [[fregola]]\n\n* [[fresh pasta]]\n\n* [[kamutÔøΩ pasta]]\n\n* [[long pasta]]\n\n* [[malfatti]]\n\n* [[other classifications:]]\n\n* [[pasta ascuitta]]\n\n* [[pasta sheet]]\n\n* [[quinoa pasta]]\n\n* [[ribbed pasta]]\n\n* [[rice pasta]]\n\n* [[rods]]\n\n* [[short pasta]]\n\n* [[smooth pasta]]\n\n* [[soy pasta]]\n\n* [[spelt pasta]]\n\n* [[suggested varieties:]]\n\n* [[truffle pasta]]\n\n* [[whole wheat pasta]]",

Some fruits -- like quinces, gooseberries, tart apples, and sour plums -- contain enough natural pectin that they'll thicken all by themselves into preserves. Others, like cherries and some berries, need an extra boost to firm up. Jam recipes for pectin-deficient fruit normally call for liquid or powdered pectin, which you can find among the baking supplies in most supermarkets. The recipes usually specify what brand of pectin to use, and it's not a good idea to substitute one brand for another, since they have different formulas. Some brands (like Sure Jell and Certo) need acid and sugar to set, some (like Sure Jell for Low Sugar Recipes) need acid and just a little sugar to set, some (like Pomona's Universal PectinÔøΩ or Mrs. Wages Lite Home Jell Fruit PectinÔøΩ) don't need any sugar to set.

The dough dries out quickly, so work fast once you've opened the package, and cover any unused dough with plastic wrap topped with a damp towel. Use fresh dough if you can find it; it doesn't tear as easily as the frozen kind.

In addition to pickling or canning with it, you can also use pickling salt just as you would ordinary table salt, though without the anti-caking agents it may get lumpy if exposed to moisture.

When the nuts are mature enough to eat, the shells split open enough that they can be pulled off easily with your fingers. Unopened shells contain immature kernels and should be discarded. Pistachios are available shelled or unshelled, salted or unsalted, roasted or raw.

One drawback is that it includes part of the animal's backbone, which adds flavor but can make the roast hard to slice after cooking. One solution is to ask your butcher either to cut off the bone and tie it back on or to cut through the backbone in several places so that you can easily slice the cooked roast into chops. If the backbone is removed and the ribs are \"Frenched\" or trimmed of meat, this cut is called a rack of pork. To make a crown roast of pork, get two racks and tie them into a circular crown. Your roast will be moister if the butcher doesn't trim the big slab of fat that usually comes with this cut. The roast will be moister if you cut the fat off after the roast is cooked.

    "content": "raw milk = real milk = fresh milk A few decades ago, the cream in milk would rise to the top and a glass of milk sitting on the counter would gradually turn sour. No more. Most commercial milk today is homogenized so that the fat is broken into small particles which remain suspended in the milk, and pasteurized to kill bacteria, including the friendly varieties that gave milk a sour tang. Raw milk isn't pasteurized; producers instead keep their cows and dairies clean in order to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. Some people insist raw milk is more healthful than commercial milk since it contains active enzymes that help with digestion and absorption of nutrients. Many cheesemakers prefer it since pasteurization diminishes the cheese's flavor potential and homogenization gives it a waxy texture. Unfortunately, it's illegal to sell raw milk in many states. Substitutes: Nonfat milk mixed with whipping cream (When making cheese, this corrects the texture problem resulting from homogenization.) OR powdered lowfat milk mixed with whipping cream (Also corrects texture problem when making cheese.) OR acidophilis milk (Friendly bacteria is reintroduced into this milk after pasteurization.)\n\n### Links\n\n* [[milk \u0026 cream]]",

Each rib will feed about two people, so if you're feeding, say, six people, you should get a three-rib roast. You can buy this cut as a standing rib roast, with the bones left in, or as a rolled rib roast, which is boned, then rolled and tied. The nice thing about a standing rib roast is that it can stand by itself in the oven pan without a rack, plus the bones provide added flavor. A large end rib roast is cut from the part of the rib section nearest the chuck, so the steaks are bigger but tougher. The small end rib roast = sirloin tip roast includes the ribs next to the choice loin section, so the meat's more tender and lean. If the short ribs are lopped off of a rib roast, you get a half standing rib roast. A steak cut from a rib roast is called a rib steak.

It doesn't actually go into the ice cream, as some have learned the hard way, but rather into the wooden ice-filled tub that surrounds the bucket of ice cream. The salt lowers the freezing point of the ice, which causes it to melt. As it melts, it absorbs heat from the ice cream, helping it to freeze more quickly. Use a ratio of one part rock salt for every five parts of ice. If you're out of rock salt, other kinds of salt will also work, though you should use less since finer grains of salt can can be packed more densely into a cup than large chunks of rock salt. The biggest danger is that you'll use too much salt, which will make your ice cream freeze too fast and become crusty. When using salt other than rock salt, start with a modest amount and check the ice cream after you've churned it for ten minutes. If the ice cream is just beginning to firm up, you have the right amount of salt. If it's not yet firming up, you need to add more salt. If it's crusty along the sides of the bucket, then you've added too much salt. Substitutes: kosher salt (more expensive) OR table salt (more expensive)\n\n### Links\n\n* [[salt]]",

    "title": "salt",
    "content": "salt = sodium chloride Most recipes that call for salt are referring to table salt, which has additives like iodine (to prevent a thyroid disease), and an anti-caking agent so the salt won't get lumpy in humid weather. Salt connoisseurs, though, often prefer to use Kosher salt for cooking, and sea salt for table use. They claim that both have a softer flavor than table salt. Exotic salts include the expensive French and Hawaiian sea salts, the smoky, sulfuric Indian black salt, and the intensely salty Korean bamboo salt. Specialized salts include pickling salt, which is free of the additives that turn pickles dark and the pickling liquid cloudy, and rock salt, used primarily to de-ice driveways and make ice cream.\n\n### Tips\n* Adding salt to water will raise the temperature at which it boils and lower the temperature at which it freezes.\n* Though we need some salt in our diet, most Americans consume much more than necessary. Too much salt can lead to high blood pressure.\n* Salt is a terrific flavor enhancer, helping to reduce bitterness and acidity, and bringing out other flavors in the food.\n* Adding salt to bread dough controls the action of the yeast and improves the flavor. Bread made without salt will have a coarser texture and a blander flavor than bread made with salt.\n* Try sprinkling salt on citrus fruit, melons, tomatoes, and even wine to enhance flavor.\n* Adding a little salt balances the flavor of sweets like cakes, cookies, and candies.\n* Boiling eggs in salted water makes them easier to peel.\n* Adding a pinch of salt (preferably non-iodized) to cream or egg whites before they're whipped increases their volume and serves as a stabilizer.\n* Salt is a mineral, so it can be stored indefinitely without going stale. It won't taste any fresher if you grind it with a salt mill.\n* Salt has been used for millennia as a preservative for meats, fish, cheese, and other foods. It works by absorbing moisture from the cells of bacteria and mold through osmosis, which kills them or leaves them unable to reproduce.\n* Salting slices of eggplants helps draw out the bitter juices.\n* Sprinkling salt on meat before broiling or grilling it draws moisture from the center, making it browner on the outside, but less juicy on the inside.\n\n### Substitutes\n* citrus zest (for seasoning)\n* pepper (for seasoning)\n* herbs (for seasoning)\n* soy sauce (for seasoning)\n* hatcho miso (especially in hearty soups and stews; 1 teaspoon salt = 2 tablespoons hatcho miso)\n* salt substitute\n* kelp powder\n* omit (Reducing salt in a recipe reduces sodium, but doing so may impair flavor and, in the case of baked goods, texture.

Some recipes call for non-iodized salt, since iodine can impart a bitter taste and adversely react with certain foods. For example, iodine darkens pickles and inhibits the bacterial fermentation needed to make sauerkraut. Table salt also contains small amounts of calcium silicate, an anti-caking agent, and dextrose, a stabilizer. The anti-caking agent in both iodized and non-iodized salt doesn't dissolve in water, so if you pickle or can with it, it will turn the liquid cloudy or else settle on the bottom of the jar. The preserved food will taste the same, mind you, but it won't look as appealing. This is more of a problem for pickles, which are immersed in lots of liquid, than for other canned goods. To prevent the cloudiness, use pickling salt, which contains no additives. Substitutes: Kosher salt (This is more flavorful, and great for cooking. Since it's less dense, grind it first or use up to twice as much.) OR sea salt (more expensive)\n\n### Links\n\n* [[salt]]",

Once you've added the thickener, the fat will be harder to remove.\n* Flour is a good thickener for gravies, gumbos, and stews, since it gives them a smooth, velvety texture. It's best to mix it with fat first, either by making a roux or beurre maniÔøΩ, or by flouring and frying stew meat before adding a liquid to the pot. If you wish to cut fat from your diet, you can instead mix the flour with water and add it to the sauce, but you'll need to cook it for quite awhile to get rid of the starchy, raw flour taste. Sauces thickened with flour become opaque, and they may become become thin again if they're cooked too long or if they're frozen and then thawed.\n* Starch thickeners like cornstarch are mixed with an equal amount of cold water, then added to warm liquids to thicken them. They're a good choice if you want a low-fat, neutral-tasting thickener. They give dishes a glossy sheen, which looks wonderful if you're making a dessert sauce or pie filling, but a bit artificial in a gravy or stew.\n* If you get lumps in your sauce from a thickener, blend the sauce in a blender or food processor until it's smooth.\n* Cereal grains like oatmeal, couscous, soup pasta, farina, are often used to thicken soups.\n* Reduction is a slow but low-fat way of thickening sauces and concentrating flavors. Just cook down the sauce in an uncovered pan until it's thickened to your liking.\n* Meat and fish glaces are a time-consuming--or expensive, if you buy them ready-made--way of thickening and enriching sauces. They're made by reducing stocks until they're thick and gelatinous.\n* A good way to thicken soups or stews is to add grated starchy vegetables, or to purÔøΩe the vegetables in the sauce.\n* Nuts make good, flavorful thickeners for stews, though they're often expensive and high in fat. Just grind them down to a flour or butter, and add them to the dish.\n* Egg yolks add a silky, velvety texture to soups and sauces, but they'll turn into scrambled eggs if they're not introduced carefully into the hot liquid.\n* Cream, once reduced, gives sauces a rich texture and flavor as it thickens them, but it's high in fat. To make a low-fat cream sauce, use evaporated milk mixed with a starch thickener.\n* Yogurt is a popular soup thickener in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.\n\n### Substitutes\n\n\n### Links\n\n* [[beurre maniÔøΩ]]\n\n* [[egg yolk]]\n\n* [[gelatins]]\n\n* [[gelatins]]\n\n* [[instant-blending flour]]\n\n* [[pectin]]\n\n* [[roux]]\n\n* [[starch thickeners]]\n\n* [[starch thickeners]]\n\n* [[thickenthinÔøΩ]]\n\n* [[tips:]]",

You can eat them raw in salads, salsas, or sandwiches, cook them to make sauces, stuff them and bake them, or grill them on skewers with other vegetables. Summertime is the the best season for tomatoes; those sold at other times of the year are often bland. Indeed, better cooks often prefer canned tomatoes for their sauces over fresh out-of-season tomatoes. Select tomatoes that are brightly colored, smooth skinned, and heavy for their size.

Both are delicious sprinkled on pasta, but the black truffle oil is better suited to meats and heavy sauces while the white is the best choice for fish dishes, cream sauces, and vinaigrettes.

Truffles are highly perishable, so you should plan to use them within a few days after buying them. To preserve them, add slices of them to bourbon, then use the bourbon and truffle pieces to flavor sauces. Fresh truffles are often sold in containers filled with rice.

It's widely used throughout the world to flavor desserts, like baked goods, ice cream, beverages, and custards, but some chefs use it as a secret ingredient in savory dishes as well. Pure extracts made with vanilla from the Bourbon Islands, which include Madagascar, is especially well-regarded. Mexican vanilla extract is also excellent, and even more potent, but it's sometimes adulterated with a dangerous food additive that's banned by the FDA. Look for vanilla extract among the baking supplies in your supermarket. To make your own: Cut two fresh (moist and pliable) vanilla beans into small pieces and put them in a small, clean jar. Pour vodka, brandy, or light rum into the jar until the vanilla is completely covered. Seal the jar with a tight-fitting lid, allow the mixture to steep for about at least a month, then strain out the beans using cheesecloth or a coffee filter. The result won't be as strong as commercial extracts, so use more. Substitutes: vanilla powder (use half as much) OR vanilla bean (Extract the flavor by scraping out the seeds and putting them and the vanilla pod into a liquid that's used in the recipe and let it simmer awhile. When the liquid has been infused with vanilla flavor, remove the pod. One inch of fresh vanilla bean = one teaspoon extract. Use a longer piece of vanilla if it's not fresh.) OR imitation vanilla extract (This may be less potent than pure vanilla extract, so you may need to use more.) OR Kosher vanilla sugar (for Passover) OR vanilla-flavored liqueur (1 teaspoon extract = 1 tablespoon liqueur) OR almond liqueur (1 teaspoon extract = 1 tablespoon liqueur) OR rum (1 teaspoon extract = 1 tablespoon rum) OR almond extract (use less) OR peppermint extract (use 1/8 as much)\n\n### Links\n\n* [[extracts and flavoring oils]]",

Verjus doesn't, so it's a good substitute for vinegar if you're planning to serve an expensive wine with dinner. Some people also mix it with sparkling water and ice to make a sophisticated non-alcoholic drink. After the bottle is opened, store verjus in the refrigerator, where it will keep for about a month. If you can't use it that fast, pour it into ice cube trays, freeze, then store the cubes in a plastic bag in the freezer. Though becoming more popular, verjus is still hard to find.

A red wine should be served at room temperature, and it goes well with hearty, meat-based dishes like steak and spaghetti. White and blush wines should be served chilled, and they go best with lighter fare, like fish and chicken. Many wines, called varietals, are named after the variety of grape used to make them. Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, and Pinot Noir are popular red varietals, while Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, and Johannisberg Riesling are popular white ones. In Europe, some wines, often blends of different varietals, are named after the place where the wine is produced, like Bordeaux, Burgundy, Chablis, Rhine, and RhÔøΩne. These European wines are often superb, but American wines that have borrowed these regional names, like California Chablis, are almost always mediocre. If you're buying a domestic wine, it's often better to go with a varietal, like a California Cabernet Sauvignon. equal parts grape juice and broth (in stews and sauces) OR wine essence OR coffee (in baked chocolate or nut dishes) OR fruit juice (in baked fruit dishes) OR vinegar (in marinades) OR broth OR verjus (in salad dressings) OR lemon juice (in salad dressings)\n\n### Tips\nfalse\n\n### Substitutes\n\n\n### Links\n\n* [[aromatized wine]]\n\n* [[blush wines]]\n\n* [[blush wines]]\n\n* [[cooking wine]]\n\n* [[de-alcoholized wine]]\n\n* [[dessert wines]]\n\n* [[dessert wines]]\n\n* [[fortified wines]]\n\n* [[fortified wines]]\n\n* [[fruit wines]]\n\n* [[fruit wines]]\n\n* [[kosher wine]]\n\n* [[other classifications:]]\n\n* [[red wines]]\n\n* [[red wines]]\n\n* [[rice wines]]\n\n* [[rice wines]]\n\n* [[sparkling wines]]\n\n* [[sparkling wines]]\n\n* [[table wine]]\n\n* [[white wines]]\n\n* [[white wines]]",

    "content": "yeast Notes: Yeast is a one-celled fungus that converts sugar and starch into carbon dioxide bubbles and alcohol. This has made it a useful ally in the production of bread, beer, and wine. There are many varieties of yeast. Bread is made with baker's yeast, which creates lots of bubbles that become trapped in the dough, making the bread rise so it's light and airy when baked. A small amount of alcohol is also produced, but this burns off as the bread bakes. Beer yeast and wine yeast are used to convert sugar into alcohol and, in the case of beer and champagne, bubbles. You should never eat raw active yeast, since it will continue to grow in your intestine and rob your body of valuable nutrients. But once deactivated through pasteurization, yeast is a good source of nutrients. Brewer's yeast and nutritional yeast, for example, are sold as nutritional supplements, and Australians are fond of yeast extracts--like Vegemite, Marmite, and Promite--which they spread like peanut butter on bread.\n\n### Tips\nfalse\n\n### Substitutes\n\n\n### Links\n\n* [[active dry yeast]]\n\n* [[baker's yeast]]\n\n* [[beer yeast]]\n\n* [[bread machine yeast]]\n\n* [[brewer's yeast]]\n\n* [[fresh yeast]]\n\n* [[instant yeast]]\n\n* [[nutritional yeast]]\n\n* [[smoked yeast]]\n\n* [[wine ball]]\n\n* [[wine yeast]]\n\n* [[yeast extract]]\n\n* [[yeast starter]]",

    "title": "yeast starter",
    "content": "yeast starter = sponge = levain 2 cups yeast starter = 1 package active dry yeast Notes: A starter is a mixture of flour, water, and other ingredients that's been colonized by wild airborne yeast and friendly bacteria. These one-celled immigrants lend the starter--and the breads made with it--a special character. Sourdough starter, for example, contains a strain of yeast that's tolerant of the lactic and acetic acids produced by the lactobacilli. Those acids give sourdough bread its characteristic tang. The French use a soupy starter called a poolish to make their breads, while the Italians use a thicker one called a biga. Up until the late 19th century, all yeast breads were leavened with starters, and keeping a starter alive in its crock was a routine household chore. To keep your own starter alive, wait until it's established, then store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. To keep it healthy, bring it to room temperature once a week and remove all but about 25% of it (either make bread with it or discard it). Replace what you've taken with a mixture of equal parts warm water and flour, stir, then return it to the refrigerator. Properly maintained, a starter can last for decades, developing an ever more distinctive character as it ages. To use a starter to make bread, remove some of it (usually about 2 cups), and use it in place of other forms of yeast. Replace the amount you took with a mixture of equal parts flour and warm water. Discard your starter if it becomes orange or pink, or if it develops an unpleasant odor. It's easy to make starters from scratch, but even easier to borrow some from a friend. Since sourdough starters must be colonized by strains of yeast and lactobacilli that are particular to certain regions (like San Francisco), a homemade starter might not yield sour bread. Your best bet is to get a powdered sourdough starter mix from your supermarket or a mail order supplier. To make your own: Sprinkle 1 package of active dry yeast on 2 cups of warm water, wait 10 minutes, then stir in 2 cups of flour. Cover loosely, and let the mixture sit at about 85ÔøΩ.\n\n### Links\n\n* [[yeast]]",

    "content": "## Configuration\nQuartz is designed to be extremely configurable. You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml\nname: Your name here! # Shows in the footer\nenableToc: true # Whether to show a Table of Contents\nenableLinkPreview: true # whether to render card previews for links\ndescription: Page description to show to search engines\npage_title: Quartz Example Page # Default Page Title\n\nlinks: # Links to show in footer\n  - link_name: Twitter\n    link: https://twitter.com/_jzhao\n  - link_name: Github\n    link: https://github.com/jackyzha0\n```\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml\nenableLegend: false # automatically generate a legend\nenableDrag: true # allow dragging nodes in the graph\nenableZoom: true # allow zooming and panning the graph\ndepth: -1 # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\npaths: # colour specific nodes path off of their path\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what actually gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Multilingual\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```",

It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\nüîó [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n### Ignoring Files\nOnly want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n‚ùå [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md)\n\n### Folder Structure\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\n\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.*\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```markdown",

    "content": "---\n\n## GitHub Pages\nQuartz is designed to be effortless to deploy. If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`.\n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`.\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden. If you're ready to start writing content already, check out the recommended flow for editing notes in Quartz.\n\n‚úèÔ∏è [Editing Notes in Quartz](notes/editing.md)\n\nHaving problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Updating\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations? On Unix/Mac systems you can run the following command for a one-line update! This command will show you a log summary of all commits since you last updated, press `q` to acknowledge this. Then, it will show you each change in turn and press `y` to accept the patch or `n` to reject it. Usually you should press `y` for most of these unless it conflicts with existing changes you've made! \n\n```shell\nmake update\n\n# or, if you don't want the interactive parts and just want the update\nmake update-force\n```\n\nOr, manually checkout the changes yourself.\n\n\u003e ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING** ‚ö†Ô∏è\n\u003e\n\u003e If you customized the files in `data/`, or anything inside `layouts/`, your customization may be overwritten!\n\u003e Make sure you have a copy of these changes if you don't want to lose them.\n\n\n```shell\n# add Quartz as a remote host\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:jackyzha0/quartz.git\n\n# index and fetch changes\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -p upstream/hugo -- layouts .github Makefile assets/js assets/styles/base.scss assets/styles/darkmode.scss config.toml data \n```",

    "content": "Still having trouble? Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)",
